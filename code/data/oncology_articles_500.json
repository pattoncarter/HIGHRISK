    "title": "Noninvasive prognostication of hepatocellular carcinoma based on cell-free DNA methylation.",
    "abstract": "The current noninvasive prognostic evaluation methods for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which are largely reliant on radiographic imaging features and serum biomarkers such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), have limited effectiveness in discriminating patient outcomes. Identification of new prognostic biomarkers is a critical unmet need to improve treatment decision-making. Epigenetic changes in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) have shown promise in early cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Thus, we aim to evaluate the potential of cfDNA methylation as a noninvasive predictor for prognostication in patients with active, radiographically viable HCC. Using Illumina HumanMethylation450 array data of 377 HCC tumors and 50 adjacent normal tissues obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we identified 158 HCC-related DNA methylation markers associated with overall survival (OS). This signature was further validated in 29 HCC tumor tissue samples. Subsequently, we applied the signature to an independent cohort of 52 patients with plasma cfDNA samples by calculating the cfDNA methylation-based risk score (methRisk) via random survival forest models with 10-fold cross-validation for the prognostication of OS. The cfDNA-based methRisk showed strong discriminatory power when evaluated as a single predictor for OS (3-year AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.81, 95% CI: 0.68-0.94). Integrating the methRisk with existing risk indices like Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC) staging significantly improved the noninvasive prognostic assessments for OS (3-year AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.91, 95% CI: 0.80-1), and methRisk remained an independent predictor of survival in the multivariate Cox model (P = 0.007). Our study serves as a pilot study demonstrating that cfDNA methylation biomarkers assessed from a peripheral blood draw can stratify HCC patients into clinically meaningful risk groups. These findings indicate that cfDNA methylation is a promising noninvasive prognostic biomarker for HCC, providing a proof-of-concept for its potential clinical utility and laying the groundwork for broader applications.",

    "title": "Solute carrier family 2 member 2 (glucose transporter 2): a common factor of hepatocyte and hepatocellular carcinoma differentiation.",
    "abstract": "GLUT2 (SLC2A2), a vital glucose transporter in liver, pancreas, and kidney tissues, regulates blood glucose levels and energy metabolism. Beyond its metabolic role, SLC2A2 contributes to cell differentiation and metabolic adaptation during embryogenesis and tissue regeneration. Despite its significance, the role of SLC2A2 in liver differentiation and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains underexplored. This study investigated SLC2A2's role in liver differentiation using in silico, in vitro, and in vivo approaches. Analysis of GEO datasets (GSE132606, GSE25417, GSE67848) and TCGA HCC data revealed that while SLC2A2 expression decreases with HCC progression, stemness-associated genes, including SOX2 and POU5F1, are upregulated. Zebrafish embryos injected with SLC2A2-targeting morpholino exhibited reduced expression of the liver differentiation marker fabp10a without significantly altering the hepatoblast marker hhex. In HepG2 cells, SLC2A2 knockdown increased stemness and IGF1R pathway markers, indicating a shift toward less differentiated states. These findings suggest that SLC2A2 supports liver differentiation by regulating glucose metabolism and suppressing pathways associated with stemness and malignancy. Targeting SLC2A2 may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for liver-related diseases, particularly HCC, by addressing its dual role in differentiation and tumor progression. Further mechanistic studies are warranted to fully elucidate these processes.",

    "title": "Ethnic Sensitivity Assessment of Mosunetuzumab Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics in Chinese Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Follicular Lymphoma.",
    "abstract": "Mosunetuzumab, a CD20\u2009\u00d7\u2009CD3 T-cell-engaging bispecific antibody, redirects T cells to eliminate malignant B cells. The purpose of YO43555 was to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, tolerability, and efficacy of mosunetuzumab as a single agent in Chinese patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (R/R FL). The impact of ethnicity/region on the PK disposition of mosunetuzumab was assessed by non-compartmental analysis (NCA) as well as a population PK (popPK) approach. A previously established popPK model for intravenous mosunetuzumab, built from the global Phase I/II study GO29781, was externally validated with the PK data from study YO43555. Results from the PK analysis showed that the global popPK model adequately captured the individual PK of the Chinese population. The model predicted mosunetuzumab exposure metrics in Chinese patients were similar to those observed in Asian patients in the GO29781 R/R FL subpopulation with the same dose regimen, while the exposure differences between Chinese and Non-Asians from the global population were\u2009<\u200920%. An overlay of the exposure levels for Chinese patients on the established E-R relationship in global patients indicated that the mosunetuzumab exposure of Chinese patients remained within the established bounds for clinical safety and efficacy. The cytokine biomarkers IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 showed similar time-course patterns of release as observed in globally enrolled patients. In summary, mosunetuzumab PK disposition did not show significant ethnic sensitivity that would impact patient outcomes. Therefore, dose adjustment of the globally approved mosunetuzumab regimen is not warranted for Chinese patients with R/R FL. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02500407.",

    "title": "Prognostic significance of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations in stage II/III colorectal cancer: A retrospective study and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "The prognostic significance of KRAS and BRAF mutations is well-established in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) but remains uncertain in early-stage tumors. This study retrospectively analyzed 47 stage II/III CRC patients undergoing curative surgery to assess the association of mutations in KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Additionally, a meta-analysis was conducted to validate the prognostic relevance of these gene mutations. We included post hoc analyses of phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in stage II/III patients receiving adjuvant therapy after curative resection in the meta-analysis. Pooled hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using a random-effect model in the overall population, stratified subgroups adjusted for microsatellite instability (MSI) status, and within MSI-high (MSI-H) and microsatellite-stable (MSS) populations. In the retrospective cohort, mutations in KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA were identified in 29.8%, 4.3%, 8.5%, and 14.9% of patients, respectively. No significant association between individual genes and survival was observed. However, in MSS patients, concurrent mutations were significantly associated with shorter OS and DFS (log-rank test, P\u2009<\u20090.05). The meta-analysis incorporated 13 eligible studies, including 15,034 patients. Pooled analyses revealed that KRAS and BRAF mutations were significantly linked to poor OS (KRAS: HR\u2009= 1.25, 95%CI: 1.06-1.47, P\u2009=\u20090.008; BRAF: HR\u2009=\u20091.43, 95%CI: 1.26-1.63, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and DFS (KRAS: HR\u2009=\u20091.36, 95%CI: 1.21-1.53, P\u2009<\u20090.001; BRAF: HR\u2009=\u20091.21, 95%CI: 1.02-1.44, P\u2009=\u20090.032). The prognostic impact of BRAF mutation increased with MSI adjustment compared those without MSI adjustment. In MSS tumors, KRAS-mutant patients demonstrated significantly shorter DFS (HR\u2009=\u20091.63, 95%CI: 1.25-2.13, P\u2009<\u20090.001), while BRAF-mutant patients exhibited reduced OS (HR\u2009=\u20091.53, 95%CI: 1.24-1.89, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and DFS (HR\u2009=\u20091.72, 95%CI: 1.20-2.46, P\u2009=\u20090.003) compared to wildtype patients. Conversely, no significant survival differences were found between mutant and wildtype patients in the MSI-H population. Although PIK3CA mutation was nominally associated with OS (HR\u2009=\u20090.86, 95%CI: 0.75-1.00, P\u2009=\u20090.046), the pooled result lacked robustness. In conclusion, KRAS and BRAF mutations had a negative prognostic impact on MSS stage II/III CRC patients receiving adjuvant therapy following curative resection. These patients may benefit from more effective adjuvant treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "CD8 T cells play a critical role in antitumor immunity. However, over time, they often become dysfunctional or exhausted and ultimately fail to control tumor growth. To effectively harness CD8 T cells for cancer immunotherapy, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms that govern their differentiation and function is crucial. This review summarizes our current knowledge of the molecular pathways that regulate CD8 T cell heterogeneity and function in chronic infection and cancer and outlines how T cells respond to therapeutic checkpoint blockade. We explore how T cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic factors influence CD8 T cell differentiation, fate choices, and functional states and ultimately dictate their response to therapy. Identifying cells that orchestrate long-term antitumor immunity and understanding the mechanisms that govern their development and persistence are critical steps toward improving cancer immunotherapy.",

    "title": "Changes in local mineral homeostasis facilitate the formation of benign and malignant testicular microcalcifications.",
    "abstract": "Testicular microcalcifications consist of hydroxyapatite and have been associated with an increased risk of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) but are also found in benign cases such as loss-of-function variants in the phosphate transporter <i>SLC34A2</i>. Here, we show that fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a regulator of phosphate homeostasis, is expressed in testicular germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS), embryonal carcinoma (EC), and human embryonic stem cells. FGF23 is not glycosylated in TGCTs and therefore cleaved into a C-terminal fragment which competitively antagonizes full-length FGF23. Here, <i>Fgf23</i> knockout mice presented with marked calcifications in the epididymis, spermatogenic arrest, and focally germ cells expressing the osteoblast marker Osteocalcin (gene name: <i>Bglap</i>, protein name). Moreover, the frequent testicular microcalcifications in mice with no functional androgen receptor and lack of circulating gonadotropins are associated with lower <i>Slc34a2</i> and higher <i>Bglap</i>/<i>Slc34a1</i> (protein name: NPT2a) expression compared with wild-type mice. In accordance, human testicular specimens with microcalcifications also have lower <i>SLC34A2</i> and a subpopulation of germ cells express phosphate transporter NPT2a, Osteocalcin, and RUNX2 highlighting aberrant local phosphate handling and expression of bone-specific proteins. Mineral disturbance in vitro using calcium or phosphate treatment induced deposition of calcium phosphate in a spermatogonial cell line and this effect was fully rescued by the mineralization inhibitor pyrophosphate. In conclusion, testicular microcalcifications arise secondary to local alterations in mineral homeostasis, which in combination with impaired Sertoli cell function and reduced levels of mineralization inhibitors due to high alkaline phosphatase activity in GCNIS and TGCTs facilitate osteogenic-like differentiation of testicular cells and deposition of hydroxyapatite.",

Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator Cox regression was applied to screen a minimal set of genes and construct a prognostic cancer-associated fibroblast-related gene signature for diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Kaplan-Meier plots and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess the prognostic performance of the prognostic cancer-associated fibroblast-related genes. A nomogram encompassing the clinical information and prognostic scores of the patients was constructed.

The nomogram showed stronger prognostic ability than the clinical factor-based model or the risk score alone. We also observed significant differences in immune cell profiles and therapeutic responses between the two groups, offering valuable insights for developing personalized treatments for diffuse large B cell lymphoma.ConclusionsWe developed a prognostic cancer-associated fibroblast-related gene-based genetic risk model to predict the prognosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma, potentially aiding in treatment selection.",

    "title": "Geographic Variation of Racial and Ethnic Differences in Uterine Cancer Survival.",
    "abstract": "Racial and ethnic disparities in uterine cancer survival are well-documented; however, limited data exist regarding the interplay of geography, diversity, and race and ethnicity in survival disparities. To examine associations of race and ethnicity with uterine cancer-specific survival according to geographic region and regional diversity. This retrospective cohort study included patients with uterine cancer diagnosed from 2000 to 2019, from 17 Surveillance, Epidemiology, End Results registries, grouped by US location and ranked according to the US Census Bureau's Diversity Index (DI; range, 0%-100%; higher values indicate greater diversity), a metric of racial and ethnic composition. Analyses were conducted from June 8, 2024 to October 30, 2024. Race and ethnicity of patients with uterine cancer, categorized as Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for multivariable-adjusted associations of race and ethnicity with uterine cancer-specific survival (primary outcome) in the overall sample and stratified by location. Location-stratified models were used to examine whether associations of race and ethnicity with survival varied by tumor characteristics. Among 162\u202f500 patients with uterine cancer (median [IQR] age at diagnosis, 61 [54-69] years), there were 12\u202f226 Asian patients (7.5%), 14\u202f007 Black patients (8.6%), 20\u202f799 Hispanic patients (12.8%), and 115\u202f468 White patients (71.1%). Cancer-specific survival was better among Asian patients (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.86-0.97), worse among Black patients (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.28-1.40), and not different among Hispanic patients (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.97-1.06) compared with White patients. Location-stratified analyses found worse uterine cancer-specific survival among Black patients compared with White patients in both higher DI locations (California: HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.25-1.44; DI, 69.7%; New Jersey: HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.21-1.50; DI, 65.8%; Georgia: HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.26-1.53; DI\u2009=\u200964.1%) and lower DI locations (Louisiana: HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.16-1.54; DI\u2009=\u200958.6%; Connecticut: HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.17-1.72; DI, 55.7%; Iowa: HR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.01-2.89; DI, 30.8%). Hispanic patients, compared with White patients, had worse survival in Hawaii (HR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.28-3.42) and Georgia (HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.13-1.82), whereas Asian patients had better survival than White patients in California (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84-0.97). In locations demonstrating survival disparities between Black and White patients, these patterns were evident in most tumor characteristic-defined strata. In this cohort study of patients with uterine cancer, racial and ethnic disparities in survival within specific geographic areas were identified. Targeted research may reduce national disparities.",

    "title": "Immunohistochemical Expression of PARK2 and YAP in Oral Epithelial Dysplasia and Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.",
    "abstract": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma is the most prevalent of all the oral cancers. There is no definitive marker available for its early diagnosis and its effective prognosis. YAP serves as a transcriptional regulator in hippo tumor suppressor pathway thereby activating the transcription of genes taking part in cellular proliferation, alteration, migration, and invasion. On the contrary, PARK2 acts as a tumor suppressor and has been widely explored in various malignancies. However, its role in OSCC carcinogenesis is untrodden. To evaluate the Immunohistochemical expression of YAP and PARK2 in oral epithelial dysplasia and Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma and establish them as prognostic markers. The study sample consisted of 70 formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections of normal oral mucosa (10), oral epithelial dysplasia (30) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (30). Immunohistochemical analysis of YAP and PARK2 was done and final scores were calculated. Further, the markers were graded as low and high expression groups. Statistical analysis was done using chi-square test, cox regression analysis and Spearman's correlation. Kaplan Meier plot for survival analysis was also plotted. Immunohistochemical expression of YAP depicted a gradual incline from normal oral mucosa to oral squamous cell carcinoma while PARK2 showed a reverse trend. Significant difference of YAP and PARK2 expression between three groups was noted. Inverse moderate degree of correlation was observed between both the markers in OSCC group. Concomitant immunoexpression of YAP and PARK2 with a moderate degree of inverse correlation from normal oral mucosa to oral squamous cell carcinoma could probably serve as diagnostic and prognostic markers as they might act through a common mechanism, probably hippo/YAP signaling, which could be further confirmed by larger sample size, including longer follow up in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Ghost cell odontogenic carcinoma (GCOC) is a rare malignant neoplasm that has a propensity for the maxilla, with a male predilection, and approximately sixty-four cases reported to date. We herein report the sixty-fifth case in a 38-year-old male patient with maxillary lesion, along with an extensive literature review. A 38-year-old male patient was referred to the oral and maxillofacial surgery clinic at King Fahad Medical City (KFMC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, with a nonhealing proliferative growth in the anterior maxilla for two months. Microscopically, the lesion showed ghost cells and dentinoid deposition with ameloblastoma-like epithelial linings and malignant features, including nuclear pleomorphism, increased mitosis, necrosis, perivascular invasion, and invasion into adjacent bone. The tumor cells were reactive to CAM5.2, p63, CK5/6 and CK19, with CK5/6 and CK19 being positive in the peripheral area in a ring-like pattern in the ghost cell region. Additionally, nuclear staining of beta-catenin was detected while next generation sequencing revealed mutations in the CTNNB1 variant c.110\u00a0C\u2009>\u2009G p.(Ser37Cys) and the ARID1A variant c.4420\u00a0C\u2009>\u2009T p. (Gln1474*), respectively, at the high variant allele. The patient was treated with surgical excision and bilateral cervical lymph node dissection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy, and the patient was free of disease after 30 months. Ghost cell odontogenic carcinoma is a rare aggressive odontogenic tumor that can be challenging to diagnose, especially with incisional biopsy. CTNNB1 is a consistent gene mutation in this tumor; however, ARID1A was reported for the first time in our patient.",

    "title": "Upregulated ATG4B predicts poor prognosis and correlates with angiogenesis in osteosarcoma.",
    "abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone cancer in children and adolescents. Between 35 and 45% of these patients do not respond to standard chemotherapeutic treatments, resulting in a very low 5-year survival rate of only 5-20%. This resistance often leads to treatment failure and unfavorable prognoses, highlighting the critical need for new therapeutic targets to improve treatment strategies. Autophagy-related gene 4 B (ATG4B) is a crucial cysteine protease for autophagosome formation. It is overexpressed and correlates with poor prognosis in various cancers. However, the relationship between ATG4B expression and angiogenesis in OS remains unexplored. This study investigated the expression levels of ATG4B and VEGF in OS and their correlation with clinicopathological data. This study included 67 paraffin-embedded OS tissue samples. ATG4B and VEGF expression levels were assessed via immunohistochemistry, and their associations with clinicopathological variables were statistically analyzed. Additionally, ATG4B gene expression in OS was examined via GEO datasets from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov . ATG4B and VEGF were expressed in 79.1% and 74.6% of the osteosarcoma samples, respectively. There was a significant positive correlation between ATG4B expression and tumor size, tumor stage, and histological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with p values of 0.013, 0.008, and 0.022, respectively. VEGF expression was also significantly correlated with tumor size, tumor stage, and the presence of distant metastasis at diagnosis, with p values of 0.022, 0.044, and 0.013, respectively. A notable positive correlation between ATG4B and VEGF expression levels was observed (p=0.002), which was supported by the GEO dataset analysis. High ATG4B and VEGF overexpression were significantly associated with worse overall survival by univariate analysis. The results suggest that ATG4B acts as a tumor promoter in OS, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target to inhibit tumor growth. Elevated ATG4B levels may also serve as a marker for poor prognosis. Additionally, VEGF overexpression is linked to a greater likelihood of pulmonary metastasis and a worse overall prognosis. The positive correlation between ATG4B and VEGF suggests that the absence of both markers could be indicative of a better chemotherapy response, offering insights into potential new treatment approaches.",

    "abstract": "Limited data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) focusing on oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) are available. The present study was conducted to explore genetic associations for OTSCC. A GWAS on 376 cases of OTSCC was conducted using the FinnGen Data Freeze-12 dataset. The case-cohort included 205 males and 171 females. Cases with malignancies involving the base of the tongue or lingual tonsil were excluded from the case-cohort. Individuals with no recorded history of malignancy were used as controls (n\u2009=\u2009407,067).

    "abstract": "This scoping review was conducted to ascertain the loss of heterozygosity\u00a0(LOH) signatures reported in Oral Potentially Malignant Disorders (OPMD) and Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC), in the literature in the last fifty years. The Joanna Briggs Institute recommendations (2023) for scoping review were used to extract, analyze, and present the results. The review was reported according to the PRISMA guidelines for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). The most commonly reported genes associated with LOH in OPMD and OSCC are discussed. The Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis gives the significance of the protein-protein interactions (PPI) of these genes using the STRING database. An exhaustive database search of the title, abstract, and full-text screening consistent with the eligibility criteria yielded 277 studies. LOH commonly studied in OPMD and OSCC include p53 gene, p16 gene, adenomatous polyposis coli gene, retinoblastoma (Rb) gene, fragile histidine triad (FHIT) gene and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene. Chromosome loci involving 17p, 9p, 5q, 13q, 3p, and 10q were frequently reported in OPMD and OSCC. PPI analysis demonstrated strong evidence of p53 interaction with p16, FHIT, and Rb. Distinctive signatures of LOH are seen in OPMD and OSCC. The LOH patterns identified in this scoping review underline the significance of advanced molecular techniques and the need for long-term prospective cohorts to understand LOH pathophysiology in oral carcinogenesis to enable their usefulness as biomarkers in early diagnosis, treatment, and prognostication of oral cancer.",

    "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) exhibit dysregulation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and regulate the malignant biological behavior of NSCLC. The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of circRNAs plays a critical role in multiple malignant tumors, and their biological relevance in NSCLC is unclear. Herein, this study was conducted to investigate the novel functional mechanism of highly expressed circ_0000517 in NSCLC by developing in vitro experiments. We found that circ_0000517 was upregulated in NSCLC tissues and cells, and that increased circ_0000517 expression was associated with m6A modification. Biologically, silenced circ_0000517 hindered the proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells in vitro, and also suppressed the EMT-related process. Mechanistically, highly expressed circ_0000517 activated CDH6 expression and EMT evolution through sponging miR-1233-3p. Notably, miR-1233-3p had the opposite effect and reversed the promotion effect of circ_0000517 on the malignant biological behavior of NSCLC cells. Our study revealed a promising novel endogenous regulatory network that m6A-modified circ_0000517 accelerated malignant evolution of NSCLC by targeting the miR-1233-3p/CDH6 axis.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the present study is to evaluate the potential of novel molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>)-based nanocomposites for photothermal therapy. For this purpose, MoS<sub>2</sub>-CuS (MoCS) and MoS<sub>2</sub>-AuNR (MoAu) nanocomposites were synthesized by physically mixing MoS<sub>2</sub> suspensions with CuS and AuNRs, respectively. The structural and optical properties of these nanocomposites were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The photothermal performance of the nanocomposites was assessed under near-infrared (NIR) radiation at a power density of 1\u2009W/cm<sup>2</sup> for 10\u2009min. The results demonstrated that both MoCS and MoAu nanocomposites exhibited enhanced photothermal heating compared to their individual components. Furthermore, the MoAu nanocomposite generated higher photothermal heat than the MoCS nanocomposite. These findings suggest that the MoCS and MoAu nanocomposites have strong potential as novel photothermal agents for cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Melanotic Neuroectodermal Tumor of Infancy (MNTI) is a rare, locally aggressive tumor with distinct pathological features and treatment paradigms commonly occurring in the head and neck region. Microscopically, it consists of a biphasic population of small neuroblast-like cells and larger melanin-containing epithelioid cells. The main purpose of this study is to characterize clinicopathological and immunohistochemical features of MNTI at a single institution and discuss challenges in the differential diagnosis. We performed a retrospective analysis of MNTI cases diagnosed at our center during a 10-year period and discussed the differential diagnoses. Eleven MNTI cases were identified. Median patient age was 5 months. Male to Female ratio was 1.75:1. Tumor distribution was in the Maxilla (n\u2009=\u20098), Mandible (n\u2009=\u20091) greater wing of Sphenoid (n\u2009=\u20091), and Temporal bone (n\u2009=\u20091). All tumors revealed classic biphasic morphology in the resection specimens. By immunohistochemistry, 9/9 (100%) cases were positive for both AE1/AE3 and HMB45 in the larger epithelioid cells and 6/6 (100%) were positive for Synaptophysin in the smaller neuroblast-like cells. One patient had unique nested areas composed of mature glial tissue. One patient who had incomplete resection was given adjuvant radiotherapy. One patient developed a solitary ipsilateral lymph nodal metastasis. Follow-up period ranged from 1 to 93 months. All the patients were alive with no evidence of disease at the last follow-up (median: 16 months). Lack of consideration of MNTI in the differential diagnosis can lead to misdiagnosis and undue exposure to cytotoxic therapies. Awareness of the classic biphasic morphology and distinct immunoprofile of MNTI is essential.",

    "abstract": "CXC chemokines are a class of cytokines possessing chemotactic properties. Studies indicate that CXC chemokines exhibit dysregulation in miscellaneous cancer categories and are significantly associated with the advancement of tumors. Breast cancer is a commonly diagnosed and fatal cancer among the female population. Breast cancer pathogenesis and progression involve various mechanisms, including invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, and inflammation. Chemokines and their receptors are involved in all of these processes. The CXC chemokine receptors (CXCRs) and their related ligands have attracted considerable attention due to their multifaceted functions in facilitating and controlling tumor proliferation. CXCRs are expressed by both cancer cells and immune cells, and they play a crucial role in regulating the tumor microenvironment and the immune response. This review aims to assess the potential of CXCRs and CXC chemokines as therapeutic targets or biomarkers for personalized therapy. Additionally, it provides an overview of the current understanding of the expression, function, and prognostic relevance of CXCRs in breast cancer. Furthermore, the challenges and potential prospects pertaining to CXCR investigation in breast cancer are deliberated.",

    "title": "Hematopoietic stem cell translation for relapse of psoriasis. Systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Psoriasis is a chronic, systemic, autoimmune disease with a high rate of progression and relapse, making treatment a challenge and requiring new therapeutic options. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a promising therapeutic modality for hematological malignancies. Several clinical cases have found that psoriasis in patients with hematological tumor was effectively controlled after HSCT and did not have experienced recurrence during follow-up. HSCT shows considerable promise in the treatment of psoriasis and prevention of its recurrence because of its potential immunomodulatory activity. Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy of HSCT in patients with psoriasis through a systematic literature review (SLR). We systematically searched the PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science (WOS), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wanfang databases to identify studies published before May 31, 2023. All types of clinical studies were considered: patients\u2009\u2265\u200912 years old with hematologic malignancies and psoriasis undergoing HSCT therapy. We included studies if they reported on the outcomes of interest. Exclusion criteria: animal models, human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) transplants, narrative reviews, letters to the editor. MeSH and \"Key word\" terms were used. The level of evidence and the quality rating were rated Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) lists. We initially identified 90 articles, of which 20 were finally included (1 case series and 19 case reports). These twenty articles included 41 patients (33 male and 8 female, age range 12-67 years). The level of evidence was mostly 4 (JBI); the quality of evidence was met (\u2265\u200950% of JBI items). The primary outcome indicator was psoriasis recurrence in patients during the follow-up time of each study. We performed subgroup analyses of the resulting data according to type of HSCT (autologous or allogeneic transplantation), and whether or not treatment for GVHD was administered after transplantation. Synthesis without meta-analysis items (SWiM) showed that recurrence of psoriasis (and/or psoriatic arthritis) during follow-up was the primary outcome of interest. Overall, a total of 31 (75.6%) of the 41 patients included in our review did not experience recurrence during follow-up period, with a maximum follow-up of 264 months (22 years) and a minimum of 5 months. The remaining 10 patients (24.4%) experienced recurrence of psoriasis during post-transplantation follow-up, with the earliest recurrence of skin lesions occurring at 1.4 months after transplantation but the lesions disappearing at 3.5 months; and the latest recurrence occurred up to 60 months post-transplant, while the patient experienced a flare-up of psoriatic arthritis at 156 mouths, but the severity and duration of psoriasis and arthritis improved compared to pretransplant. HSCT is expected to be an effective treatment for psoriasis as well as recurrence for a wide range of psoriasis patients. Future better epidemiological designs and in-depth studies are needed to evaluate and clarify the benefits of HSCT in psoriasis. Retrospective uncontrolled study, small sample size, with some incomplete data.",

This retrospective single-center study included patients who underwent TP between January 2019 and June 2024, encompassing both primary one-step TP and planned elective completion pancreatectomy following either pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) or distal pancreatectomy (DP). Intraoperative evaluation and reconstruction of gastric venous drainage were performed when GVC was observed. Demographic, clinical, technical, perioperative, and postoperative data were analyzed. Sixteen patients underwent either one-step TP (n\u2009=\u20094) or elective completion pancreatectomy (n\u2009=\u200912), including four following DP and eight following PD. Intraoperative GVC was detected in two patients, necessitating portal vein (PV)-right gastroepiploic vein (RGEV) side-to-side anastomosis. No major complications occurred in these patients, and no GVC was observed during the postoperative follow-up period (mean: 39.8 months, range: 2.1-60.7 months). In cases where preservation of gastric drainage veins is not feasible, PV-RGEV side-to-side anastomosis can be a convenient and useful option to resolve intraoperative GVC.",

A total of 578 patients with intermediate- and high-risk NMIBC who underwent intravesical BCG induction after initial TURBT between May 2003 and April 2021 were included. Patients were subdivided into low (pH\u2009\u2264\u20095.5) and high (pH\u2009>\u20095.5) urine pH groups.

This study is to explore the auxiliary effects of different optical image enhancement algorithms on the object detection of OPMDs lesions. Digital images of OPMDs were collected, including white plaques, white stripes, and erosive lesions. The dataset was divided into a training set (6,488 images) and a validation set (2,592 images). Original images were processed using multiscale retinex (MSR), adaptive histogram equalization (AHE), and adaptive contrast enhancement (ACE), respectively. Object detection models based on You Only Look Once version 8 (YOLOv8) were used for lesion detection, and the diagnostic performance was evaluated using 328 images taken at different times. The model performance in the MSR-enhanced image set was superior to that in the original image set, with total accuracy increased for all three lesion types, and the sensitivity of complete correct recognition for complex multi-lesion images improved. Models trained with AHE and ACE preprocessing showed reduced diagnostic performance. Image enhancement algorithms can enhance the visual quality of OPMDs images, and the MSR algorithm is capable of strengthening the object detection ability in the computer vision model. This study provides an approach to reduce the misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis of OPMDs lesions in object detection model.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) are rare neoplasms. Minimal access surgery has been the favoured approach for these tumors over the past decade. There is a lack of robust data comparing laparoscopic and robotic pancreatic surgery for PNETs and this has led to the lack of a global conclusion regarding which approach is superior. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available data to compare outcomes following laparoscopic versus robotic pancreatic surgery for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Studies reporting outcomes of laparoscopic or robotic surgery for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors were included. Inverse variance and Mantel-Haenszel statistical analysis methods were used for continuous and dichotomous data, respectively. All outcomes were quantitatively analyzed using the random effects model. The risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-1 tool. A total of 14 studies with 767 patients were included. The mean difference in the operating time was 21.08\u00a0min (95% CI: -4.38, 46.54, I<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u200943%), favouring the laparoscopic group. The pooled odds ratio for the rate of formation of the pancreatic fistula was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.45, I<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090%), favouring the robotic group.

Other parameters, including re-exploration rate, length of hospital stay, R0 resection, rate of conversion, and spleen preservation, were similar in both groups. The robotic approach might be preferable to the laparoscopic approach because of the lower rate of POPF and blood loss. Larger randomised controlled trials are required to ascertain these findings.",

    "abstract": "Chromodomain-Helicase-DNA-binding protein 1 (CHD1) is a central regulator of chromatin dynamics, profoundly influencing gene expression, DNA repair, and genomic stability. This review critically explores CHD1's role in cancer biology, emphasizing its complex, context-dependent functions. In prostate cancer, CHD1 acts as both a tumour suppressor and a facilitator of neuroendocrine differentiation, with its loss linked to aggressive phenotypes, resistance to androgen receptor therapies, and synthetic lethality with PTEN loss. Beyond prostate cancer, CHD1 is implicated in breast, ovarian, and hematological cancers, where it modulates chromatin accessibility, transcription regulation, and therapy resistance. Despite its promise as a biomarker and therapeutic target, CHD1 presents challenges due to its dual roles and cancer-specific effects. The review also highlights critical gaps, including the need for high-resolution studies on CHD1's interactions with immune pathways, synthetic lethality mechanisms, and chromatin remodelling in treatment resistance. Leveraging CHD1's molecular complexities could show the way for innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in cancer, but its role in non-prostate cancers remains underexplored, warranting further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) is a potentially fatal complication of CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of EEG as a predictive biomarker of ICANS. In this prospective, monocentric, cohort study, consecutive refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients undergoing CAR T-cell therapy had EEG assessments at fixed time points pre- and post-infusion. The risk of ICANS was evaluated according to EEG findings detected qualitatively, using a grading scale ranging from 0 (normal) to 3 (severely abnormal), and quantitatively, using power spectral and connectivity measures. 307 EEGs from 68 patients have been qualitatively evaluated, of whom 238 were eligible for quantitative analysis. Neurotoxicity manifested in 22/68 (32.4%) patients. Pre-infusion EEG abnormalities (grade 1 and 2) were qualitatively detected in 8/68 (11.7%) patients, emerging as a risk factor for ICANS [HR 5.8 (95%CI 2.6-12.9)]. Quantitative analysis of pre-infusion EEGs did not yield significative results. Post-infusion qualitative EEG abnormalities were associated to a higher risk of ICANS development [HR 11.6 (4.4-30.5) for grade 2; HR 9.7 (2.6-36.6) for grade 3]. Concerning the quantitative analysis, in post-infusion EEGs higher theta energy [HR 1.10 (1.03-1.16)] and delta + theta/alfa ratio [HR 1.37 (1.11-1.67)] were associated to higher risk of ICANS, while higher beta energy resulted protective [HR 0.91 (0.85-0.97)]. Our study establishes EEG as a predictive tool for identifying patients at risk for ICANS before CAR T-cell infusion, who may benefit from prophylactic treatments, and anticipating ICANS onset following infusion, enabling early intervention.",

This was a prospective observational study at the Tata Memorial Center (Mumbai, India) in patients aged 60\u00a0years and over, planned for cancer-directed therapy. We used the COST-FACIT and CFPB Financial Well-Being Scales to assess financial toxicity. QoL was assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ C30 questionnaire, and distress with the NCCN distress thermometer. Between June 2022 and September 2023, we enrolled 953 patients. The median age was 66 (IQR 63-72) years; 277 patients (29.1%) were over 70\u00a0years old, 737 (77.3%) were male, and 135 (14.2%) had health insurance. Therapy was planned with palliative intent in 607 (63.7%) patients.

Higher financial toxicity on the COST-FACIT scale was associated with poor financial well-being on the CFPB scale. Financial toxicity was associated with poor QoL and higher distress. Factors associated with significantly greater financial toxicity included history of tobacco chewing, monthly family income less than \u20b950,000, lack of health insurance, illiteracy, depression, and cognitive impairment. Identifying the factors contributing to financial toxicity will help make the cancer treatment journey smoother, more accessible and improve compliance to therapy for older patients.

On multivariable cox regression analysis, receipt of chemotherapy was not significantly associated with incidence of BPH (p-value\u2009=\u20090.13). When stratified by diagnosis of hypogonadism prior to BPH, no significant associations were found on univariable (p\u2009=\u20090.9) as well as multivariable (p\u2009=\u20090.63) analyses. In the multivariable model, age at diagnosis was significantly associated with an increased incidence of BPH (Hazard ratio: 1.06, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Our findings demonstrate that age is a significant factor associated with development of BPH in this population, while suggesting that chemotherapy for TCa and hypogonadism might not substantially alter the development of BPH.",

    "title": "Optimizing post-acute care inpatient rehabilitation for patients with brain metastasis: A systematic review of functional outcomes.",
    "abstract": "This study aimed to provide insight into optimizing inpatient rehabilitation (IR) for patients with brain metastases (BM) following hospitalization, including exploring functional outcomes and reviewing interdisciplinary considerations. Using PRISMA guidelines, a search of PubMed and Embase was conducted to identify studies demonstrating functional outcomes of IR for patients with brain metastases. Three studies met inclusion criteria and a total of 59 patients with brain metastasis underwent IR. The median length of IR was 19.2 days (range: 17.95 - 20). Discharge destination after IR is available for 39 patients, including 33 (84.6%) who were discharged home, 1 (2.6%) who was discharged to a long-term care facility, 3 (7.7%) to an acute care ward, and 2 (5.1%) to palliative care. All 3 studies (n=59) used the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) to assess function after IR. The weighted average total FIM percent gain between admission and discharge was 14.9% (range: 9.6% - 27.4%) and the average FIM efficiency was 0.61 (range: 0.45 - 0.94). For the 2 studies (n=46) that reported motor and cognitive FIM, the weighted average motor gain (16.5%) was greater than the cognitive gain (3.6%). Inpatient rehabilitation (IR) may enhance functional status and independence in patients with brain metastases during the interim post-hospitalization period, optimizing functional performance for a smoother transition to subsequent oncologic treatments. Healthcare providers within the multidisciplinary team should optimize the post-acute hospitalization period by considering both functional status and oncologic prognosis in patients with brain metastases to streamline rehabilitation efforts and minimize delays in oncologic care.",

    "abstract": "Among patients with colon cancer undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy, the impact of resistance training with supplemental dietary protein on inflammatory changes during treatment, whether baseline or changes in inflammatory markers are associated with relative dose intensity (RDI), and the associations of inflammation with body composition were investigated. A multicenter randomized clinical trial of 174 patients with colon cancer undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy assigned to a home-based resistance training program or usual care was conducted. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 receptor-II, and growth differentiation factor-15 levels were assessed preintervention and following chemotherapy completion. Baseline body composition was evaluated via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Multivariate analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical factors. Patients randomized to resistance training versus usual care experienced similar changes in all inflammatory markers. Those in the highest versus lowest tertile of baseline hsCRP were more likely to have received RDI >70% (odds ratio, 4.11; 95% CI, 1.29-13.1); however, changes across any of the inflammatory markers were not associated with RDI. Patients in the highest versus lowest tertiles of hsCRP, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 receptor-II were more likely to have higher baseline body mass index, total lean mass, and total fat mass. Inflammatory markers in patients with colon cancer undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy were not significantly impacted by randomization to a resistance training program but were associated with baseline body composition measures. Further investigations are needed to better elucidate the potential role of inflammatory markers and body composition in predicting important treatment outcomes. GOV: NCT03291951.",

    "title": "Radiomic Features of Mesorectal Fat as Indicators of Response in Rectal Cancer Patients Undergoing Neoadjuvant Therapy.",
    "abstract": "Rectal cancer represents a major cause of mortality in the United States. Management strategies are highly individualized, depending on patient-specific factors and tumor characteristics. The therapeutic landscape is rapidly evolving, with notable advancements in response rates to both radiotherapy and chemotherapy. For locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC, defined as up to T3-4 N+), the standard of care involves total mesorectal excision (TME) following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as the gold standard for local tumor staging and is increasingly pivotal in post-treatment restaging. In our study, we proposed an MRI-based radiomic model to identify characteristic features of peritumoral mesorectal fat in two patient groups: good responders and poor responders to neoadjuvant therapy. The aim was to assess the potential presence of predictive factors for favorable or unfavorable responses to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, thereby optimizing treatment management and improving personalized clinical decision-making. We conducted a retrospective analysis of adult patients with LARC who underwent pre- and post-nCRT MRI scans. Patients were classified as good responders (Group 0) or poor responders (Group 1) based on MRI findings, including tumor volume reduction, signal intensity changes on T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and alterations in the circumferential resection margin (CRM) and extramural vascular invasion (EMVI) status. Classification criteria were based on the established literature to ensure consistency. Key clinical and imaging parameters, such as age, TNM stage, CRM involvement, and EMVI presence, were recorded. A radiomic model was developed using the LASSO algorithm for feature selection and regularization from 107 extracted radiomic features. We included 44 patients (26 males and 18 females) who, following nCRT, were categorized into Group 0 (28 patients) and Group 1 (16 patients). The pre-treatment MRI analysis identified significant features (out of 107) for each sequence based on the Mann-Whitney test and <i>t</i>-test. The LASSO algorithm selected three features (shape_Sphericity, shape_Maximum2DDiameterSlice, and glcm_Imc2) for the construction of the radiomic logistic regression model, and ROC curves were subsequently generated for each model (AUC: 0.76). We developed an MRI-based radiomic model capable of differentiating and predicting between two groups of rectal cancer patients: responders and non-responders to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT). This model has the potential to identify, at an early stage, lesions with a high likelihood of requiring surgery and those that could potentially be managed with medical treatment alone.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to assess the potential role of the ultrasound (US) monochromatic Superb Microvascular Index (mSMI) to predict malignancy of solid focal lesions, correlating the vascular index (VI) with bioptic histological results. In this single-center retrospective analysis, patients undergoing percutaneous US-guided biopsy of solid lesions were considered. Biopsy indication was given by a multidisciplinary team evaluation based on clinical radiological data. Exclusion criteria were: unfeasible SMI evaluations due to poor respiratory compliance, locations not appreciable with the SMI, previous antiangiogenetic chemo/immunotherapies, and inconclusive histological reports. The mSMI examination was conducted in order to visualize extremely low-velocity flows with a high resolution and high frame rate; the VI was semi-automatically calculated. All bioptic procedures were performed under sole US guidance using 16G or 18G needles, immediately after mSMI assessment. Forty-four patients were included (mean age: 64 years; 27 males, 17 females). Liver (15/43), kidneys (9/43), and lymph nodes (6/43) were the most frequent targets. At histopathological analysis, 7 lesions were benign and 37 malignant, metastasis being the most represented. The VI calculated in malignant lesions was statistically higher compared to benign lesions (35.45% and 11% in malignant and benign, respectively; <i>p</i>-value 0.013). A threshold VI value of 15.4% was identified to differentiate malignant lesions. The overall diagnostic accuracy of the VI with the mSMI was 0.878, demonstrating a high level of diagnostic accuracy. In this study, the mSMI analysis of solid focal lesions undergoing percutaneous biopsy significantly correlated with histological findings in terms of malignant/benign predictive value, reflecting histological vascular changes in malignant lesions.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the variability of oncogenic risk related to radiation exposure in patients frequently exposed to ionizing radiation for diagnostic purposes, specifically ICU patients, according to different risk models, including the BEIR VII, ICRP 103, and US EPA models. This was an IRB-approved observational retrospective study. A total of 71 patients (58 male, 13 female; median age, 66 years; interquartile range [IQR], 65-71 years) admitted to the ICU who underwent X-ray examinations between 1 October 2021 and 28 February 2023 were included. For each patient, the cumulative effective dose during a single hospital admission was calculated. Lifetime attributable risk (LAR) was estimated based on the BEIR VII, ICRP 103, and US EPA risk models to calculate additional oncogenic risk related to radiation exposure. The Friedman test for repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare risk values between different models. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess the consistency of risk values between different models. Different organ, leukemia, and all-cancer risk values estimated according to different oncogenic risk models were significantly different, but the intraclass correlation coefficient revealed a good (>0.75) or even excellent (>0.9) agreement between different risk models. The ICRP 103 model estimated a lower all-cancer (median 69.05 [IQR 30.35-195.37]) and leukemia risk (8.22 [3.02-27.93]) compared to the US EPA (all-cancer: 139.68 [50.51-416.16]; leukemia: 23.34 [3.47-64.37]) and BEIR VII (all-cancer: 162.08 [70.6-371.40]; leukemia: 24.66 [12.9-58.8]) models.

    "abstract": "Breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide, with limited therapeutic efficacy due to treatment resistance and adverse effects. Emerging evidence suggests that ion channels play crucial roles in tumor progression, regulating proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and metastasis. Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) and sodium (Nav) channels have been implicated in oncogenic signaling pathways. Scorpion venom peptides, known for their selective ion-channel-blocking properties, have demonstrated promising antineoplastic activity. This study explores the potential therapeutic applications of bioactive fractions derived from <i>Chihuahuanus coahuilae</i>, in breast cancer cell lines. Through chromatographic separation, mass spectrometry, and functional assays, we assess their effects on cell viability, proliferation, and ion channel modulation. Our preliminary data suggest that these venom-derived peptides interfere with cancer cell homeostasis by altering ion fluxes, promoting apoptosis, and inhibiting metastatic traits. These findings support the therapeutic potential of ion-channel-targeting peptides as selective anticancer agents. Further investigations into their molecular mechanisms may pave the way for novel, targeted therapies with improved efficacy and specificity for breast cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Research on viper venom has expanded into diverse medical applications, including cancer treatment. This study investigates the potential of <i>Vipera ammodytes</i> venom in oncology, evaluating its cytotoxicity and chemosensitising effects on malignant melanoma cells. Proteomic analysis identified 125 proteins in the venom, with Phospholipases A2, C-type lectins, and metalloproteinases among the most abundant components. These proteins are associated with cytotoxic, anti-proliferative, and tumor-inhibiting properties. Three melanoma cell lines (M001, Me501, and A375) were used to assess venom cytotoxicity. The IC50 values demonstrated consistent venom sensitivity across cell lines (approximately 1.1 \u00b5g/mL). Combined treatment with venom and cisplatin significantly increased the cytotoxicity compared to single-agent treatments. Notably, venom enhanced the sensitivity of cisplatin in resistant cell lines (M001 and Me501), increasing cell mortality by up to 40%. The A375 cell line, inherently more sensitive to cisplatin, exhibited additional cytotoxic effects only at higher venom doses. The morphological changes observed under microscopy confirmed venom-induced cellular changes, further supporting its potential as an anti-cancer agent. The selective targeting of melanoma cells by venom components, particularly in muscle-associated metastases, suggests a unique therapeutic niche. While cisplatin was chosen for this pilot study due to its established cytotoxicity, future research will explore venom combinations with contemporary treatments such as immunotherapy and targeted therapies. Although preliminary, these findings provide a foundation for integrating venom-based strategies into advanced melanoma protocols, aiming to improve outcomes in resistant or metastatic cases.",

Representative users participated in a 4-step usability study using a \"think-aloud\" protocol, complemented with feature satisfaction, difficulty perceived, and design impression surveys along with a short, structured interview. Participants were also asked to provide quantitative feedback via the postuse System Usability Scale, User Experience Questionnaire, and Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire. The data were analyzed along the lines of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9241-210 framework. All participants found the intervention content useful, and they reported satisfactory usability, with a mean Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire score of 2.458 (SD 1.08) and a System Usability Scale score of 68.9.

Marine eukaryotic microalgae are rapidly advancing as a source of anticancer drugs due to their ability to produce potent secondary metabolites with biological activity. Among such microalgae, dinoflagellates, belonging to the species <i>Amphidinium carterae</i>, are known producers of neurotoxins and cytotoxic compounds. We tested the capability of chemical extracts from two different strains of <i>A. carterae</i> to modulate the EMT markers in T98G, human GBM cells. In vitro proliferation and migration studies and EMT biomarkers' abundance and modulation assays showed that the different <i>A. carterae</i> strains differently modulated both EMT markers and the proliferation/migration capability of GBM cells.

    "abstract": "Lung cancer, particularly non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with cisplatin-based chemotherapy being a standard treatment. However, the development of chemoresistance significantly limits its efficacy, necessitating alternative therapeutic approaches. Here, we demonstrate the anticancer effects of the extracts of <i>Allium pseudojaponicum Makino</i> (APE), a salt-tolerant plant, in cisplatin-resistant NSCLC. Metabolite profiling using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS<sup>E</sup> identified 13 major compounds, predominantly alkaloids (71.65%) and flavonoids (8.81%), with key bioactive constituents such as lycorine (29.81%), tazettine (17.22%), and tricetin (8.19%). APE significantly inhibited cell viability in A549 and H460 cells, reducing viability to 38.6% (A549-Ctr), 37.2% (A549-CR), 28.4% (H460-Ctr), and 30.4% (H460-CR) at 40 \u00b5g/mL after 48 h. APE also suppressed colony formation by over 90% in both 2D and soft agar assays, while showing no cytotoxicity in normal human keratinocytes up to 80 \u00b5g/mL. Flow cytometry analysis revealed APE-induced G1 phase arrest, with the G1 population increasing from 50.4% to 56.6% (A549-Ctr) and 47.5% to 58.4% (A549-CR), accompanied by reduced S phase populations. This effect was associated with the downregulation of G1/S transition regulators, including cyclin D1, CDK4, cyclin E, and CDK2. Furthermore, proteomic analysis identified STAT3 signaling as a major target of APE; APE decreased phosphorylated STAT3 and c-Myc expression, and STAT3 knockdown phenocopied the effects of APE. These findings highlight the potential of APE as a natural product-based therapeutic strategy for overcoming cisplatin resistance in NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) presents a significant therapeutic challenge due to the absence of specific targeted treatments. In this study, we explored the therapeutic potential of xanthocillin X dimethyl ether (XanDME), a naturally occurring isocyanide isolated from the marine fungus <i>Scedosporium apiospermum</i>, on TNBC. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we initially demonstrated that XanDME directly binds to hemin, the oxidized form of heme, in vitro, corroborating previous reports. This interaction led to the depletion of intracellular regulatory heme. We further established that XanDME translocates into the mitochondria, where it interacts with crucial hemoproteins, namely cytochromes. The binding of XanDME with mitochondrial cytochromes disrupts the electron transport chain (ETC), inhibits the activity of mitochondrial complexes, and inactivates mitochondrial respiration. The inhibitory activity of XanDME on mitochondrial function significantly contributes to its anti-TNBC effects, as observed both in vitro and in vivo. Our study underscores the potential of XanDME against TNBC, warranting further investigations.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to PARP inhibitors (PARPi), such as olaparib (OLA), is a major challenge in ovarian cancer treatment. In this study, we investigated the combination effect of PARPi and gukulenin A (GUA), a bis-tropolone tetraterpenoid isolated from the marine sponge <i>Phorbas gukhulensis</i>. We found that GUA at a mildly cytotoxic dose synergistically enhanced OLA-induced cytotoxicity in human ovarian cancer cells. The combination treatment significantly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and lipid peroxidation, leading to ferroptotic rather than apoptotic cell death. Network pharmacology and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses revealed oxidative stress-related pathways as key mediators of this effect. Inhibition of NADPH oxidase (NOX) reversed combination-induced cell death, while ferrostatin-1 (FER-1), a ferroptosis inhibitor, significantly reduced lipid peroxidation and cytotoxicity. Additionally, GUA and OLA treatment suppressed ERK1/2 activation, and ERK overexpression attenuated the combination-induced cell death. Collectively, these findings suggest that marine-derived GUA enhances PARPi efficacy in ovarian cancer cells by inducing ferroptosis through oxidative stress and ERK pathway modulation.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is currently the third most common malignancy, and the toxic side effects of clinical therapeutic drugs often influence treatment outcomes. Marine-derived quinolone alkaloids exhibit various biological activities and are particularly notable for their antitumor properties. Compounds <b>1</b>-<b>13</b> were semi-synthesized based on 4'-desmethoxyyaequinolone J1, which is a 4-phenyl derivative of the natural quinolone alkaloid yaequinolone J1 and was isolated from <i>Penicillium</i> sp. FKI-2140. This study is the first to investigate the antitumor activity of <b>1</b>-<b>13</b> in colorectal cancer cells through proliferation, clonality, apoptosis, cell cycle, and MAPK signaling pathway. Cytotoxicity screening against seven colorectal cancer cell lines revealed that CHNQD-02792 (<b>13</b>) had the most sensitivity to HT-29 cells (IC<sub>50</sub> = 4.5 \u03bcM), far exceeding positive control 5-fluorouracil (IC<sub>50</sub> = 15.58 \u03bcM). The plate cloning assay revealed that CHNQD-02792 completely inhibited the growth of HT-29 cells at the concentration of 9 \u03bcM. CHNQD-02792 (4.5 \u03bcM) inhibited CDK1 expression and triggered G2/M phase arrest in HT-29 cells. Mechanistic analysis revealed that CHNQD-02792 induced apoptosis by suppressing the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and upregulating the pro-apoptotic proteins Caspase-3 and Bax. Furthermore, CHNQD-02792 inhibited ERK and JNK phosphorylation and thus highlighted its regulatory role in MAPK signaling. These findings suggest that CHNQD-02792 exerts cytotoxic effects on HT-29 cells via dual mechanisms: inducing G2/M arrest and apoptosis while regulating MAPK signaling through ERK/JNK dephosphorylation. This study demonstrates the dual targeting of CHNQD-02792 against tumor cell proliferation and survival pathways, providing a foundation for further development of anti-colorectal cancer drugs.",

    "abstract": "CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have been well-regarded as \"helper\" cells in activating the cytotoxicity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells for effective tumor eradication, while few studies have focused on whether CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells regulate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Our previous studies provided evidence for an interaction between CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells after cryo-thermal therapy, but the mechanism remains unclear, especially pertaining to how CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells promote the Th1 differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. This study revealed that activated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are critical for CTT-induced antitumor immunity, and the interaction between activated T cells is enhanced. The reciprocal regulation of activated CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was through LFA-1/ICAM-1 interactions, in which CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells facilitate Notch1-dependent CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1-dominant differentiation and promote IL-2 secretion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Meanwhile, IL-2 derived from CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells enhances the cytotoxicity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and establishes a positive feedback loop via increasing the expression of LFA-1 and ICAM-1 on T cells. Clinical analyses further validated that LFA-1/ICAM interactions between CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are correlated with clinical outcomes.

    "title": "LncRNAs Regulate Vasculogenic Mimicry in Human Cancers.",
    "abstract": "Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) has recently been discovered as an alternative mechanism for nourishing cancer cells in vivo. During VM, tumor cells align and organize themselves into three-dimensional (3D) channel-like structures to transport nutrients and oxygen to the internal layers of tumors. This mechanism mainly occurs in aggressive solid tumors and has been associated with poor prognosis in oncologic patients. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are essential regulators of protein-encoding genes involved in cancer development and progression. These single-stranded RNA molecules regulate critical cellular functions in cancer cells including cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, VM, therapy response, migration, invasion, and metastasis. Recently, high-throughput RNA-sequencing technologies have identified thousands of lncRNAs, but only a small percentage of them have been functionally characterized in human cancers. The vast amount of data about its genomic expression in tumors can allow us to dissect their functions in cancer biology and make them suitable biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. In this study, we reviewed the current knowledge about the role of lncRNAs in regulating VM in cancer. We also examined the molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs and highlight several commonalities in the cellular functions associated with VM between diverse cancer types. Future directions for research focused on deciphering their function in VM are delineated. Finally, the potential of selected lncRNAs as novel therapeutic targets in RNA-based molecular interventions is also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignant disease in women worldwide. Several studies have reported that microRNA-146a (miR-146a) dysregulation plays a role in multiple cancers, including BC. However, the mechanism underlying this association is controversial, possibly reflecting diverse roles for this miR in different types of cancer. The SNP rs2910164:G>C, located within the miR-146a precursor, has been linked to a BC risk. Our group previously showed a specific association between rs2910164:G>C and an increased BC risk in patients with early-onset sporadic BC. There are no studies in the literature that evaluate the functional consequences of the rs2910164 polymorphism in the BC process. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to evaluate in vitro the effect of the SNP rs2910164:G>C on BC progression in luminal A and triple-negative cell lines. We found that rs2910164:G>C upregulated the expression of two mature miR-146a sequences, 3p and 5p. Furthermore, pre-miR-146a-C enhanced proliferation, migration, and invasion in luminal A and triple-negative breast cells, as well as decreasing cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, the pre-miR-146a C allele decreased cisplatin resistance in MCF-7 cells but increased cisplatin resistance in MDA-MB-231 cells. We propose that the rs2910164 C allele promotes miR-146a overexpression, which is causally involved in proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis, and cisplatin resistance.",

    "abstract": "As part of chemotherapy regimens, Paclitaxel improves the overall survival of many non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, the development of drug resistance and adverse events limits its clinical usage, reinforcing the need for further advancements in NSCLC therapeutics. We recently recognized the adiponectin receptor agonist AdipoRon as a promising anticancer compound in NSCLC. Consequently, this study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of combining AdipoRon with Paclitaxel (Combo) in NSCLC cells. With respect to individual treatments, Combo triggered a stronger inhibition of both cell growth and clonogenic potential, as well as a greater induction of cell death. The Combo-mediated cytotoxicity was also corroborated by cleavage of poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3 apoptotic markers. Notably, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) emerged as a critical sensor in Combo efficacy, as its inhibition by Compound-C unveiled a significant rescue in cell growth. Although Combo caused a gradual downregulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), the hindrance in the upstream cascade by PD98059 partially counteracted the Combo outcomes. In conclusion, our findings designate AdipoRon as an effective candidate in Paclitaxel-based therapy. Nevertheless, future studies aimed at exploring the Combo aptitude in overcoming the Paclitaxel-related restraints need to be investigated in NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4\u03b1 (HNF4\u03b1), a highly conserved member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors, has been identified as a promising therapeutic candidate for colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRAC). This study was to investigate the significance of HNF4\u03b1 in CRAC and mechanisms governing its function. The expression patterns and clinical relevance of HNF4\u03b1 were evaluated in relation to nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03bab), Yes-associated protein (YAP), and epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers. HNF4\u03b1 exhibited upregulation during carcinogenesis compared to normal and precancerous lesions. The overexpression and inhibition of HNF4\u03b1 were correlated with the modulation of CRAC cell migration and invasion, either promoting or suppressing these processes. Notably, levels of HNF4\u03b1 were significantly diminished in metastatic and poorly differentiated CRAC relative to primary CRAC samples. Moreover, reduced HNF4\u03b1 levels were associated with unfavorable prognostic factors. The inhibition of HNF4A induced a decrease in NF-\u03bab protein levels, concomitant with an increase in YAP. Our results indicate a dual role of HNF4\u03b1 in tumor progression, either as a promotor or inhibitor, depending on the pathologic condition of CRAC and the related signaling pathways. HNF4\u03b1 exhibits a complex role, whereby its overexpression is linked to early carcinogenesis and reduced expression is associated with the progression and metastasis of CRAC.",

    "abstract": "Tumor metabolism has emerged as a critical target in cancer therapy, revolutionizing our understanding of how cancer cells grow, survive, and respond to treatment. Historically, cancer research focused on genetic mutations driving tumorigenesis, but in recent decades, metabolic reprogramming has been recognized as a hallmark of cancer. The TP53 inducible glycolysis and apoptosis regulator, or TIGAR, affects a wide range of cellular and molecular processes and plays a key role in cancer cell metabolism by regulating the balance between glycolysis and antioxidant defense mechanisms. Cancer cells often exhibit a shift towards aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect), which allows rapid energy production and gives rise to biosynthetic intermediates for proliferation. By inhibiting glycolysis, TIGAR can reduce the proliferation rate of cancer cells, particularly in early-stage tumors or specific tissue types. This metabolic shift may limit the resources available for rapid cell division, thereby exerting a tumor-suppressive effect. However, this metabolic shift also leads to increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can damage the cell if not properly managed. TIGAR helps protect cancer cells from excessive ROS by promoting the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which generates NADPH-a key molecule involved in antioxidant defense. Through its actions, TIGAR decreases the glycolytic flux while increasing the diversion of glucose-6-phosphate into the PPP. This reduces ROS levels and supports biosynthesis and cell survival by maintaining the balance of nucleotides and lipids. The role of TIGAR has been emerging as a prognostic and potential therapeutic target in different types of cancers. This review highlights the role of TIGAR in different types of cancer, evaluating its potential role as a diagnostic marker and a therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Endometrial cancer is one of the most common malignancies seen in women in developed countries. While patients in the early stages of this cancer show better responses to surgery, adjuvant hormonal therapy, and chemotherapy, patients with recurrence show treatment resistance. Researchers have recently focused on cancer stem cells (CSCs) in the treatment of gynecologic cancer in general but also specifically in endometrial cancer. CSCs have been investigated because of their resistance to conventional therapies, such as chemo- and radiotherapy, and their ability to induce the progression and recurrence of malignancy. The activation of alternative pathways, such as WNT, PI3K, NF-kB, or NOTCH, could be the basis of the acquisition of these abilities of CSCs. Their specific markers and signaling pathways could be treatment targets for CSCs. In this article, we discuss the importance of obtaining a better understanding of the molecular basis and pathways of CSCs in endometrial cancer and the role of CSCs, aiming to discover more specific therapeutic approaches.",

The degree and mechanisms by which molecularly and phenotypically diverse tumor-propagating glioma stem cells (GSCs) contribute to this state are poorly defined. In this study, our multifaceted approach combining bioinformatics analyses of clinical and experimental datasets, single-cell sequencing, and the molecular and pharmacologic manipulation of patient-derived cells identified GSCs expressing immunosuppressive effectors mimicking regulatory T cells (Tregs). We showed that this immunosuppressive Treg-like (ITL) GSC state is specific to the mesenchymal GSC subset and is associated with and driven specifically by TGF\u03b2 type II receptor (TGFBR2) in contrast to TGFBR1. Transgenic TGFBR2 expression in patient-derived GBM neurospheres promoted a mesenchymal transition and induced a six-gene ITL signature consisting of <i>CD274</i> (PD-L1), <i>NT5E</i> (CD73), <i>ENTPD1</i> (CD39), <i>LGALS1</i> (galectin-1), <i>PDCD1LG2</i> (PD-L2), and <i>TGFB1</i>. This TGFBR2-driven ITL signature was identified in clinical GBM specimens, patient-derived GSCs, and systemic mesenchymal malignancies. TGFBR2<sup>high</sup> GSCs inhibited CD4+ and CD8+ T cell viability and their capacity to kill GBM cells, effects reversed by pharmacologic and shRNA-based TGFBR2 inhibition. Collectively, our data identify an immunosuppressive GSC state that is TGFBR2-dependent and susceptible to TGFBR2-targeted therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a nuclear chromatin protein overexpressed in various cancers and linked to tumor progression. Outside the cell, HMGB1 binds to receptors such as the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), promoting metastasis. Targeting this signaling pathway may provide a new therapeutic strategy for aggressive cancers. Metformin, a well-established antidiabetic drug, directly interacts with HMGB1, inhibiting its pro-inflammatory functions. This study investigates metformin's effects on the HMGB1/RAGE signaling pathway in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Using wound-healing and colony formation assays, we demonstrate that metformin reduces HMGB1-induced cell migration and proliferation. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analyses reveal that metformin decreases RAGE stabilization on the cell membrane, disrupts NF-\u03baB signaling, and reverses the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by increasing E-cadherin, reducing vimentin, and stabilizing \u03b2-catenin at the cell membrane. Furthermore, metformin lowers HMGB1 and RAGE protein levels, disrupting the positive feedback loop that promotes cancer aggressiveness. These findings highlight metformin's potential as a therapeutic agent in TNBC by inhibiting HMGB1/RAGE-driven metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer with the highest number of new cases diagnosed in Europe and in Poland, remains an example of malignancy with a very poor prognosis despite the recent progress in medicine. Different treatment strategies are now available for cancer therapy based on its type, molecular subtype and other factors including overall health, the stage of disease and cancer molecular profile. Immunotherapy is emerging as a potential addition to surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or other targeted therapies, but also considered a mainstay therapy mode. This combination is an area of active investigation in order to enhance efficacy and overcome resistance. Due to the complexity and dynamic of cancer's ecosystem, novel therapeutic targets and strategies need continued research into the cellular and molecular mechanisms within the tumour microenvironment. From the genetic point of view, several signatures ranging from a few mutated genes to hundreds of them have been identified and associated with therapy resistance and metastatic potential. ML techniques and AI can enhance the predictive potential of genetic signatures and model the prognosis. Here, we present the overview of already existing treatment approaches, the current findings of key aspects of immunotherapy, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), existing molecular biomarkers like PD-L1 expression, tumour mutation burden, immunoscore, and neoantigens, as well as their roles as predictive markers for treatment response and resistance.",

    "abstract": "Beyond the genomic and proteomic analysis of bulk and single cancer cells, a new focus of cancer research is emerging that is based on the mechanical analysis of cancer cells. Therefore, several biophysical techniques have been developed and adapted. The characterization of cancer cells, like human cancer cell lines, started with their mechanical characterization at mostly a single timepoint. A universal hypothesis has been proposed that cancer cells need to be softer to migrate and invade tissues and subsequently metastasize in targeted organs. Thus, the softness of cancer cells has been suggested to serve as a universal physical marker for the malignancy of cancer types. However, it has turned out that there exists the opposite phenomenon, namely that stiffer cancer cells are more migratory and invasive and therefore lead to more metastases. These contradictory results question the universality of the role of softness of cancer cells in the malignant progression of cancers. Another problem is that the various biophysical techniques used can affect the mechanical properties of cancer cells, making it even more difficult to compare the results of different studies. Apart from the instrumentation, the culture and measurement conditions of the cancer cells can influence the mechanical measurements. The review highlights the main advances of the mechanical characterization of cancer cells, discusses the strength and weaknesses of the approaches, and questions whether the passive mechanical characterization of cancer cells is still state-of-the art. Besides the cell models, conditions and biophysical setups, the role of the microenvironment on the mechanical characteristics of cancer cells is presented and debated. Finally, combinatorial approaches to determine the malignant potential of tumors, such as the involvement of the ECM, the cells in a homogeneous or heterogeneous association, or biological multi-omics analyses, together with the dynamic-mechanical analysis of cancer cells, are highlighted as new frontiers of research.",

    "title": "The Role of GREMLIN1, a Bone Morphogenetic Protein Antagonist, in Cancer Stem Cell Regulation.",
    "abstract": "Cancer remains a leading cause of death globally, characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation, tumor growth and metastasis. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and their growth differentiation factor (GDF) relatives are crucial regulators of developmental processes such as limb, kidney and lung formation, cell fate determination, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of self-renewing cells within tumors that possess stemness properties and a tumor cell-forming capability. The presence of CSCs in a tumor is linked to growth, metastasis, treatment resistance and cancer recurrence. The tumor microenvironment in which CSCs exist also plays a critical role in the onset, progression and treatment resistance in many cancers. Growth factors such as BMPs and GDFs counterbalance transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) in the maintenance of CSC pluripotency and cancer cell differentiation. BMP signaling typically functions in a tumor suppressor role in various cancers by inducing CSC differentiation and suppressing stemness characteristics. This differentiation process is vital, as it curtails the self-renewal capacity that characterizes CSCs, thereby limiting their ability to sustain tumor growth. The interplay between BMPs and their secreted antagonists, such as GREM1, Noggin and Chordin, adds another layer of complexity to CSC regulation. Human cancers such as gastric, colorectal, glioblastoma, and breast cancer are characterized by GREMLIN1 (GREM1) overexpression, leading to inhibition of BMP signaling, facilitating the maintenance of pluripotency in CSCs, thus promoting tumorigenesis. GREM1 overexpression may also contribute to CSC immune evasion, further exacerbating patient prognoses. In addition to BMP inhibition, GREM1 has been implicated as a target of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) \u2192 Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling, as well as the Wnt/Frizzled pathway, both of which may contribute to the maintenance of CSC stemness. The complex role of BMPs and their antagonists in regulating CSC behavior underscores the importance of a balanced BMP signaling pathway. This article will summarize current knowledge of BMP and GREM1 regulation of CSC function, as well as conflicting data on the exact role of GREM1 in modulating CSC biology, tumor formation and cancer. Targeting this pathway by inhibiting GREM1 using neutralizing antibodies or small molecules may hold early-stage promise for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing CSC burden in cancers and improving patient outcomes.",

A major factor contributing to the poor prognosis of neoplastic diseases is the development of drug resistance. It significantly reduces the utility of most therapeutic protocols and necessitates the search for novel biomarkers and treatment strategies to combat cancer. An evolutionarily conserved catabolic mechanism, autophagy maintains nutrient recycling and metabolic adaptation and is also closely related to carcinogenesis, playing a dual role. Autophagy inhibition can limit the growth of tumors and improve the response to cancer therapeutics. Lysosomes, key players in autophagy, are also considered promising targets for anticancer treatment. There are still insufficient data on the role of poorly studied glycoproteins related to autophagy, such as the lysosome-associated membrane glycoproteins (LAMPs). They can act as multifunctional molecules involved in a multitude of processes like autophagy and cancer development. In the current review, we summarize the recent data on the double-faceted role of autophagy in cancer with a focus on drug resistance in CRC and on the roles of lysosomes and LAMPs in these interconnected processes. Several lysosomotropic drugs are discussed as options to overcome cancer cell chemoresistance. The complex networks that underline defined autophagic pathways in the context of CRC carcinogenesis and the role of autophagy, especially of LAMPs as drivers of drug resistance, are outlined.",

Artesunate (ART) a derivative of artemisinin, used in Traditional Chinese Medicine, shows anti-tumor activity extending over a broad spectrum of human cancers. As we have previously shown, ART inhibits growth in cisplatin-sensitive (parental) and cisplatin-resistant BCa cells. However, how ART acts on the metastatic potential of BCa remained unclear. To clarify, we applied ART to parental and cisplatin-resistant RT4, RT112, T24, and TCCSup BCa cell lines. We examined tumor cell adhesion to vascular endothelium and immobilized collagen and evaluated chemotactic activity, migration, and invasive activity of the BCa cells. Adhesion receptors, integrin \u03b1 and \u03b2 subtypes, integrin-linked kinase (ILK), and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) were investigated. The functional relevance of integrin expression altered by ART was determined by blocking studies. ART significantly reduced tumor cell adhesion to vascular endothelium and immobilized collagen in parental as well as in cisplatin-resistant BCa cells. Depending on cell type, ART suppressed tumor cell motility and diminished integrin expression (surface and total). Functional blocking of integrins altered by ART reduced cell adhesion and invasion of the BCa cells. Thus, the metastatic potential of parental and cisplatin-resistant BCa cells was significantly inhibited by ART, making it a promising treatment option for patients with advanced or therapy-resistant BCa.",

    "abstract": "It has long been hypothesized that systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) increases radiosensitivity, but recent studies have yielded mixed results. We studied individual radiosensitivity in 70 individuals with SLE using chromosomal aberrations as biomarkers of radiosensitivity. In total, 33 patients with SLE and 37 patients with SLE and additional oncologic diseases were compared with healthy individuals and with patients with rectal and breast cancer. Individual radiosensitivity was assessed by ex vivo irradiation of G0 blood lymphocytes followed by three-color fluorescence in situ hybridization of chromosomes 1, 2, and 4. SLE patients have slightly higher background rates of chromosomal aberrations than healthy individuals and lower rates than cancer patients. Non-oncologic SLE patients show a rate of chromosomal aberrations similar to that seen in healthy individuals. The outliers in this group, who clearly show increased radiosensitivity, fall between healthy individuals and cancer patients. Patients with SLE and cancer have significantly higher chromosome aberration rates compared to healthy individuals (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and patients with isolated cancer (<i>p</i> = 0.007) or isolated SLE (<i>p</i> = 0.004). The proportion of radiosensitive patients in the oncologic SLE cohort is high, with 45% of patients showing increased radiosensitivity. There is a weak association between anti-Ro-52 autoantibodies and radiosensitivity. Based on the radiosensitivity measurement, radiation dose reduction was recommended in 11 oncological SLE patients and was successfully achieved in 5 patients by up to 21% of the dose per fraction. In the oncologic SLE cohort, a substantial portion of individuals show increased radiosensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is a chronic condition marked by persistent intestinal inflammation of unknown etiology. Disease onset involves genetic predisposition and environmental factors that disrupt the intestinal immune homeostasis.

Advances in molecular therapies and early interventions have reduced surgery rates; however, colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant concern, driven by chronic inflammation. In UC, the risk of UC-associated neoplasia (UCAN) increases with disease duration, while CD patients face elevated risks of small intestine, anal fistula, and anal canal cancers. Endoscopic surveillance is advised for UCAN, but optimal screening intervals remain undefined, and no established guidelines exist for CD-associated cancers. UCAN morphology often complicates detection due to its flat, inflammation-blended appearance, which differs pathologically from sporadic CRC (sCRC). UCAN is frequently surrounded by dysplasia, with p53 mutations evident at the dysplasia stage.

    "title": "Thinking Outside the Therapeutic Box: The Potential of Polyphenols in Preventing Chemotherapy-Induced Endothelial Dysfunction.",
    "abstract": "The numerous side effects and adverse health implications associated with chemotherapies have long plagued the field of cancer care. Whilst in some cases a curative measure, this highly toxic intervention consistently scores poorly on quantitative measures of tolerability and safety. Of these side effects, cardiac and microvascular defects pose the greatest health risk and are the leading cause of death amongst cancer survivors who do not succumb to relapse. In fact, in many low-grade cancers, the risk of recurrence is far outweighed by the cardiovascular risk of morbidity. As such, there is a pressing need to improve outcomes within these populations. Polyphenols are a group of naturally occurring metabolites that have shown potential vasoprotective effects. Studies suggest they possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, in addition to directly modulating vascular signalling pathways and gene expression. Leveraging these properties may help counteract the vascular toxicity induced by chemotherapy. In this review, we outline the main mechanisms by which the endothelium is damaged by chemotherapeutic agents and discuss the ability of polyphenols to counteract such side effects. We suggest future considerations that may help overcome some of the published limitations of these compounds that have stalled their clinical success. Finally, we briefly explore their pharmacological properties and how novel approaches could enhance their efficacy while minimising treatment-related side effects.",

    "title": "Increased Risk of Cancer-An Integral Component of the Cardio-Renal-Metabolic Disease Cluster and Its Management.",
    "abstract": "Cancer risk increases by 25 to 250% not only in dysmetabolic obese or overweight people with overt type 2 diabetes but also in individuals with intermediate hyperglycemia (pre-diabetes), with especially pronounced risk of pancreatic or hepatocellular cancer and obesity-related cancers, e.g., colorectal and kidney cancers, bladder cancer in men, and endometrial and breast cancers in women. Cancer may often be present before or upon the diagnosis of diabetes, as there is a common pathogenetic dysmetabolic-inflammatory background with insulin resistance for developing diabetes, cardiorenal disease, and cancer in parallel. The mechanisms involved relate to hyperinsulinemia as a potential carcinogenic priming event with ectopic visceral, hepatic, pancreatic, or renal fat accumulation that subsequently fuel inflammation and lipo-oncogenic signals, causing mitochondrial oxidative stress and deregulation. Moreover, hyperinsulinemia may foster mitogenic MAP kinase-related signaling, which can also occur via IGF1 receptors due to increased free IGF1 levels in obesity. Weight reduction of 10% or more in obese people with diabetes or pre-diabetes, e.g., through intensive lifestyle intervention or bariatric (=metabolic) surgery or through treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists or metformin, is associated with significantly lower incidence of \"diabesity\"-associated cancers. In conclusion, there seems to be huge utility in adopting the new \"Cardio-Renal-Metabolic-Cancer Syndrome\" approach, also looking for cancer at the time of diabetes diagnosis in addition to proactively screening for undiagnosed dysglycemia.",

    "title": "Glioblastoma Stem Cells at the Nexus of Tumor Heterogeneity, Immune Evasion, and Therapeutic Resistance.",
    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is an exceedingly aggressive primary brain tumor defined by rapid growth, extensive infiltration, and resistance to standard therapies. A central factor driving these malignancies is the subpopulation of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), which possess self-renewal capacity, multipotency, and the ability to regenerate tumor heterogeneity. GSCs contribute to key hallmarks of GBM pathobiology, including relentless progression, resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and inevitable recurrence. GSCs exhibit distinct molecular signatures, enhanced DNA repair, and metabolic adaptations that protect them against conventional treatments. Moreover, they reside within specialized niches-such as perivascular or hypoxic microenvironments-that sustain stemness, promote immunosuppression, and facilitate angiogenesis. Recent discoveries highlight signaling pathways like Notch, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, Hedgehog, STAT3-PARN, and factors such as TFPI2 and HML-2 as critical regulators of GSC maintenance, plasticity, and immune evasion. These findings underscore the complexity of GSC biology and their pivotal role in driving GBM heterogeneity and therapeutic failure. Emerging therapeutic strategies aim to target GSCs through multiple avenues, including surface markers, immunotherapeutics (e.g., CAR T cells), metabolic vulnerabilities, and combination regimens. Advances in patient-derived organoids, single-cell omics, and 3D co-culture models enable more accurate representation of the tumor ecosystem and personalized therapeutic approaches. Ultimately, improved understanding of GSC-specific targets and the tumor microenvironment promises more effective interventions, paving the way toward better clinical outcomes for GBM patients.",

We have reviewed the few cases reported in the literature and they seem to have a better response to standard therapy and overall survival than GBM in the non-NF1 population. We present two cases of long-survival NF1 patients with GBM. Case 1 was a 38-year-old woman with cerebellar GBM who underwent surgical asportation and the Stupp protocol many times with an overall survival of 117 months. Case 2 was a 47-year-old woman with GBM in the eloquent area of the right frontal lobe; she underwent surgical asportation and the Stupp protocol with an overall survival of 25 months. The data analysis demonstrates that NF1-associated GBM patients could be considered long-term survivors.",

    "title": "Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Contemporary Advanced Prostate Cancer Treatment Sequences.",
    "abstract": "There has been a proliferation of novel treatments for the management of advanced prostate cancer (PCa), including androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPI). Although there are health economic analyses of novel PCa treatments, such as ARPIs for specific health states, there is a lack of sequential analyses. Our paper aims to fill this gap. We developed a Monte Carlo Markov model to simulate the management of advanced PCa to end-of-life. We modeled patients who begin in metastatic and nonmetastatic castration-sensitive PCa (mCSPC and nmCSPC), with risk stratification for mCSPC, progressing to metastatic castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC). Using current guidelines and recent literature, we simulated admissible treatment sequences over these states along a 15-year horizon. We report the best treatment sequences in terms of efficacy and cost-effectiveness. We find that the most cost-effective use of ARPIs is early in advanced PCa for a cost-effectiveness threshold (CET) of CAD 100K per QALY. For a CET of CAD 50K per QALY, early ARPI use is most cost-effective in mCSPC-starting patients but not nmCSPC-starting. We conclude that the most cost-effective way to use ARPIs is when patients first enter advanced PCa. The most cost-effective ARPI at current Canadian prices is abiraterone, mostly due to abiraterone's lower price level.",

    "title": "40th Annual CAPO Conference-Responding to the Human Experience of Cancer and Caring for the Soul: Building on 40 Years of Global Leadership in Psychosocial Oncology.",
    "abstract": "On behalf of the Canadian Association of Psychosocial Oncology, we are pleased to present the Abstracts from the 2025 Annual Conference, titled \"Responding to the Human Experience of Cancer and Caring for the Soul: Building on 40 years of global leadership in psychosocial oncology\". The 40th Annual CAPO Conference was held in Toronto from 23 April 2025 to 25 April 2025. In an era marked by the rapid advancement of biologically focused precision medicine, it is imperative to redirect our attention towards the human experience of illness and the soul of medicine. Biomedicine has conceptualized illness in ways that have proved profoundly productive from a curative and biological point of view. But it cannot-and it does not pretend to-illuminate the experience of living with it. (Hurwitz 2009). This conference aims to delve into the intricate interplay between cutting-edge biomedical technologies inclusive of artificial intelligence and big data and the deeply personal narratives of individuals navigating illness. By shifting the focus from mere disease pathology to encompassing the holistic human experience, we aspire to foster a more compassionate and patient-centered approach to healthcare with psychosocial support at the core of humanistic care that can improve survival and well-being in all aspects of a whole-person approach to illness. Through interdisciplinary dialogue and introspection, we endeavor to illuminate the profound connection between mind, body, and spirit in the practice of medicine, reaffirming the timeless significance of empathy, understanding, and human connection in healing and psychosocial aspects of care as fundamental to living well with cancer. This conference brought together key stakeholders including multidisciplinary professionals from nursing, psychology, psychiatry, social work, spiritual care, nutrition, medicine, rehabilitation medicine, occupational health and radiation therapy for both adult and pediatric populations. Participants included clinicians, researchers, educators in cancer care, community-based organizations and patient representatives. Patients, caregivers and family members presented abstracts that speak to their role in managing cancer experiences and care. Over two hundred (200) abstracts were submitted for presentation as symposia, 20-minute oral presentations, 10-minute oral presentations, 90-minute workshops and poster presentations. We congratulate all the presenters on their research work and contribution.",

    "title": "Real-World Treatment Patterns and Outcomes Among Patients with Early Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.",
    "abstract": "Worldwide, about two million people are diagnosed with lung cancer each year, 85% of whom have non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Recent progress in treating advanced/metastatic NSCLC with targeted therapies has shifted attention to early NSCLC (Stages I-IIIA) and perioperative (neoadjuvant and adjuvant) systemic therapies. However, our comprehension of how targeted therapeutics are incorporated into care and their impact on patient outcomes is just starting to unfold. This retrospective observational study used a US nationwide electronic health record-derived deidentified database spanning January 2019-March 2024 and aimed to describe (1) eNSCLC patient demographic and clinical characteristics, (2) real-world neoadjuvant and adjuvant use, and (3) patient outcomes. The study population included 4841 Stage IB-IIIA NSCLC patients with a mean age of 70.9 \u00b1 8.6 years. The majority (69.9%) received definitive treatment: surgery (<i>n</i> = 2280), definitive radiation (<i>n</i> = 320), or definitive chemoradiation (<i>n</i> = 783), while 30.1% (<i>n</i> = 1458) did not. Many definitive treatment patients received some perioperative systemic therapy (surgery: 52.6%, radiation: 52.2%, chemoradiation: 75.5%). Neoadjuvant use was limited in all groups (surgery: 8.2%, radiation: 6.1%, chemoradiation: 11.6%). Among the 54.6% receiving adjuvant, immune checkpoint inhibitors were the most common choice for definitive radiation (39.1%) and chemoradiation (73.7%) patients, while surgical patients predominantly received platinum-doublet therapy (37.0%). Surgical patient outcomes were similar across all groups, while definitive chemoradiation or radiation patients without systemic therapy had lower survival rates. In this study, we found that although the majority of patients underwent some form of definitive treatment, adjuvant use was limited, and neoadjuvant use was rarely included in care. A crucial initial step in improving patient outcomes is to understand and address the underutilization of neoadjuvant/adjuvant systemic therapy for eNSCLC patients.",

    "abstract": "In the past few years, a new promising therapy, called bispecific T-cell engager (TCE), has been developed and is now available in many countries for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. T-cell engagers are associated with sustained efficacy and progression-free survival benefits in patients with heavily treated myeloma. However, complications such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), and infections complicate their administration, particularly in remote centers. This review discusses the key requirements for delivering TCEs therapies, focusing on outpatient delivery.

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> The cost and uptake of cancer medications dispensed as take-home treatments are not well understood. Therefore, in this study, we describe trends and the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the utilization and cost of take-home cancer medications dispensed through the public payer system in Ontario, Canada. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a repeated cross-sectional time-series analysis examining monthly and fiscal-year trends in the utilization and cost of take-home cancer medications reimbursed by the public payer between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2021, in Ontario, Canada. Our primary outcome was per-beneficiary spending. Total public payer spending and the number of unique beneficiaries who were dispensed take-home cancer medications were reported as secondary outcomes. All outcomes were reported overall and stratified by drug class. We used autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to assess the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the aforementioned trends. <b>Results:</b> Annual per-beneficiary spending on take-home cancer medications increased by 32.8% (from CAD 4422 in 2017/18 to CAD 6579 in 2020/21) over the study period. The rise in per-beneficiary spending was driven by the cost of medications within the small-molecule targeted therapy and immunotherapy drug classes, which accounted for three-quarters of total public payer spending on take-home cancer medications in 2020/21 despite being dispensed to less than 8% of beneficiaries. Upon the declaration of emergency for SARS-CoV-2, a short-term decline in per-beneficiary spending (CAD -179 per month; <i>p</i>-value < 0.01) was observed between March and June 2020. This temporary decline was driven by an increase in the number of beneficiaries (5582 per month; <i>p</i>-value < 0.01) receiving low-cost take-home cancer medications within the cytotoxic chemotherapy and hormonal therapy drug class without a corresponding rise in public payer spending. <b>Conclusion:</b> Future research should investigate barriers to the widespread uptake of take-home cancer medications during periods of public emergencies, particularly for high-cost drugs.",

    "title": "Crizotinib Inhibits Viability, Migration, and Invasion by Suppressing the <i>c-Met</i>/<i>PI3K</i>/<i>Akt</i> Pathway in the Three-Dimensional Bladder Cancer Spheroid Model.",
    "abstract": "We aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of crizotinib, a broad-spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor against bladder cancer (BC) cells, based on a three-dimensional (3D) cell culture system. After proliferating cell masses (spheroids) using T24 cisplatin-na\u00efve and T24R2 cisplatin-resistant human BC cell lines, the spheroids were exposed to various crizotinib concentrations in order to derive an ideal crizotinib concentration to suppress cell survival, migration, and invasion. Crizotinib suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in both T24 and T24R2 BC cell lines under a 3D spheroid model, which was more appropriate than the conventional two-dimensional cell culture model. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed a reduced expression of <i>E-cadherin</i> and an enhanced expression of <i>vimentin</i>, suggesting EMT suppression and the subsequent suppression of tumor aggressiveness following crizotinib administration. Meanwhile, the expressions of apoptosis-related genes increased. Western blot analysis revealed that the expression levels of <i>phosphorylated mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-Met)</i> and <i>phosphorylated Akt</i> decreased following crizotinib administration, suggesting that the antitumor effect of crizotinib can be associated with the inhibition of the phosphorylated activation of the <i>c-Met</i>/<i>PI3K</i>/<i>Akt</i> pathway. Crizotinib showed a potential antitumor effect on both cisplatin-na\u00efve and cisplatin-resistant human BC cells, likely through <i>c-Met</i>-induced <i>PI3K</i>/<i>Akt</i> pathway inhibition.",

    "abstract": "<i>Background:</i> A cancer diagnosis and its treatment often disrupt a child's and adolescent's normal level of physical activity, which plays a vital role in their development and health. They are therefore often less physically active during treatment than before the diagnosis or compared to healthy peers. Today, there is no comprehensive overview of the safety, feasibility, clinical effectiveness, and potentially long-lasting impact of physical activity (PA) interventions in this population. <i>Methods:</i> We conducted a systematic review in PubMed according to PRISMA guidelines to evaluate studies on PA interventions during cancer treatment in children and adolescents up to 25 years of age. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute's critical appraisal tools to assess the risk of bias. Due to the heterogeneity in interventions and outcomes, we used descriptive approaches only to present the results. <i>Results</i>: Half of the 21 included studies were randomized controlled trials (10/21). PA interventions were found to be safe and feasible when tailored to the patient's age, treatment phase, and clinical condition. Most studies reported improvements in physical fitness, strength, and quality of life, with some reductions in fatigue. Variability in interventions and outcomes, along with small sample sizes and heterogeneous patient populations, made it difficult to draw clear conclusions. <i>Conclusions</i>: PA appears to be a feasible and, in terms of injuries, safe adjunct to cancer treatment in children and adolescents. Despite promising trends, further large-scale, multicenter trials with standardized protocols are needed to better establish the long-term benefits and optimal interventions.",

    "abstract": "Late radiation-associated dysphagia (late-RAD) remains a challenge in head and neck cancer (HNC) survivorship, despite advancements in treatment methods. Although Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) stands as the preferred diagnostic approach for oropharyngeal dysphagia assessment in the HNC population, current studies lack a FEES-derived swallowing parameter characterization and phenotypic classification within this specific cohort. This study sought to employ FEES-based assessment to characterize swallowing safety and efficacy profiles, identify distinct phenotypes in HNC patients suffering from late-RAD, and examine potential correlations between safety and efficacy parameters. A retrospective analysis included twenty-four post-radiotherapy HNC patients evaluated using standardized FEES protocols across three bolus consistencies (liquid, semisolid, and solid). Swallowing safety was quantified using the Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS), while efficacy was measured via the Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating Scale (YPRSRS). Additionally, six distinct dysphagia phenotypes were characterized within the cohort. Propulsion deficit was the predominant phenotype (92%), followed by delayed pharyngeal phase (37.5%) and protective deficit (25%), with 46% of patients exhibiting multiple phenotypes. Unsafe swallowing occurred most frequently with liquid consistency (62.5%), while residue was most prevalent with semisolid (82.6% valleculae, 52.2% pyriform sinuses) and solid consistencies (92.3% valleculae, 53.8% pyriform sinuses). Significant correlations were found between penetration-aspiration and pharyngeal residue scores across consistencies (<i>p</i> < 0.05). FEES examination revealed distinct phenotypes in late radiation-associated dysphagia, with a predominance of propulsion deficit and significant interdependence between safety and efficacy parameters.",

While surgical resection and radiotherapy remain the standard for locoregional control, systemic treatment is indicated for recurrent or metastatic disease. Advances in molecular profiling have identified actionable targets such as NTRK gene fusions, HER2, immune checkpoint regulators, androgen receptors, and RET receptors. These have facilitated the development of targeted therapies, including TRK inhibitors, HER2-directed agents, and androgen receptor modulators, as well as emerging combinations of immunotherapy and chemotherapy.

    "abstract": "Breast reconstruction after mastectomy improves the quality of life for many patients with breast cancer. There is uncertainty regarding eligibility criteria for reconstruction, timing (immediate or delayed-with or without radiotherapy), outcomes of nipple-sparing compared to skin-sparing mastectomy, selection criteria and surgical factors influencing outcomes of nipple-sparing mastectomy, prepectoral versus subpectoral implants, use of acellular dermal matrix, and use of autologous fat grafting. We conducted a systematic review of these topics to be used as the evidence base for an updated clinical practice guideline on breast reconstruction for Ontario Health (Cancer Care Ontario). The protocol was registered on PROSPERO, CRD42023409083. Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched until August 2024, and 229 primary studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies were retrospective non-randomized comparative studies; 5 randomized controlled trials were included. Results suggest nipple-sparing mastectomy is oncologically safe, provided there is no clinical, radiological, or pathological indication of nipple-areolar complex involvement. Surgical factors, including incision location, may affect rates of complications such as necrosis. Both immediate and delayed reconstruction have similar long-term outcomes; however, immediate reconstruction may result in better short to medium-term quality of life. Evidence on whether radiotherapy should modify the timing of initial reconstruction or expander-implant exchange was very limited; studies delayed reconstruction after radiotherapy by at least 3 months and, more commonly, at least 6 months to avoid the period of acute radiation injury. Radiation after immediate reconstruction is a reasonable option. Surgical complications are similar between prepectoral and dual-plane or subpectoral reconstruction; prepectoral placement may give a better quality of life due to lower rates of long-term complications such as pain and animation deformity. Autologous fat grafting was found to be oncologically safe; its use may improve quality of life and aesthetic results.",

Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Protein-4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors and Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors or Programmed Cell Death Protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors have been assessed in both clinical and preclinical studies; the addition of radiotherapy activates immunomodulatory mechanisms materialized by an effect similar to \"in situ\" vaccination or the \"abscopal\" distant response of lesions outside the irradiation field. The new therapeutic targets (T cell immune-receptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT), Lymphocyte activating gene 3 (LAG-3), and T cell Ig- and mucin-domain-containing molecule-3 (TIM-3)) associated with traditional ICIs and radiotherapy open new perspectives to the concept of immuno-radiotherapy. The dynamic evaluation of T lymphocyte expression involved in the antitumor immune response, both in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and in the tumor itself, could have biomarker value in assessing the response to combination therapy with traditional and new ICIs in association with irradiation.

A small number of patients had a durable response to immunotherapy, and so far it has not been discovered who will benefit. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of first-line pembrolizumab in patients with locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC with high PD-L1 expression in a real-world setting. We enrolled 35 patients with locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC who had PD-L1 \u2265 50%. Progression-free survival was 9 months, 95% CI (2.6-15.4). Overall survival was 14 months, 95% CI (0-28.5). Five-year OS rate for the whole group of patients was 20%, and the six-year OS rate was 17.2%.

Brandenburg was compared to Berlin regarding perioperative treatment regimens. The resulting survival benefits were assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models. <b>Results:</b> For the years of diagnosis 2017 to 2022, 5805 cases of gastric carcinoma were documented in the cancer registry. Survival data showed no significant differences between Berlin and Brandenburg. Preoperative therapy for cT3/cT4N0 tumors was significantly more common in Berlin (72%) than in Brandenburg (68%). Perioperative therapy was associated with a survival benefit for stages T3-/T4N+ but not for stages T1N+ or T2. The lower proportion of pre-treated T3/T4N+ patients in rural Brandenburg did not result in a significant survival difference. <b>Conclusions:</b> The data provide a comprehensive representation of the current state of gastric cancer care in these two regions. Gastric cancer treatment outcomes, in terms of survival, are comparable between the rural region of Brandenburg and the urban center of Berlin.",

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> This study aimed to compare the clinical, pathological, and biochemical characteristics of upper rectal cancer (URC) and mid-lower rectal cancer (MLRC) in stage II and III non-metastatic rectal cancer and to identify distinct prognostic factors influencing survival and recurrence. <b>Material and Methods:</b> This retrospective cohort study included 100 patients with stage II and III non-metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) followed by curative-intent surgery between 2021 and 2024. Patients were categorized into URC (n = 53) and MLRC (n = 47) groups. Parameters analyzed included demographic factors, ASA score, surgical characteristics, pathological features (tumor stage, lymph node involvement, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), perineural invasion (PNI), tumor budding, tumor regression grade (TRG)), and biochemical markers (carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil count, platelet count (PLT), and C-reactive protein (CRP)). One-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and Cox regression models identified independent prognostic factors. <b>Results:</b> Preoperative CEA levels were higher in MLRC (<i>p</i> = 0.05), whereas WBC count (<i>p</i> = 0.01), neutrophil count (<i>p</i> = 0.02), PLT (<i>p</i> = 0.01), and CRP levels (<i>p</i> = 0.01) were higher in URC. Pathological analysis revealed higher LVI (<i>p</i> = 0.04), PNI (<i>p</i> = 0.04), and tumor budding (<i>p</i> = 0.03) in MLRC. At one-year follow-up, OS rates were 82.1% (URC) vs. 80.3% (MLRC) (<i>p</i> = 0.85), and DFS rates were 78.6% (URC) vs. 73.4% (MLRC) (<i>p</i> = 0.72). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified age (HR: 1.04, <i>p</i> = 0.03), ASA score (HR: 1.22, <i>p</i> = 0.01), CRP (HR: 1.18, <i>p</i> < 0.001), preoperative CEA (HR: 1.12, <i>p</i> = 0.02), preoperative CA19-9 (HR: 1.09, <i>p</i> = 0.03), LVI (HR: 1.42, <i>p</i> < 0.001), PNI (HR: 1.35, <i>p</i> = 0.02), and tumor budding (HR: 1.28, <i>p</i> = 0.03) as independent prognostic factors for OS. Similar trends were observed for DFS, with T stage (HR: 1.35, <i>p</i> = 0.01) and tumor size (HR: 1.22, <i>p</i> = 0.01) also being found significant. <b>Conclusions:</b> Inflammatory markers, tumor burden indicators (LVI, PNI, budding, tumor size, T stage), and preoperative CEA/CA19-9 were identified as significant predictors, suggesting a risk-adapted approach to rectal cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer (PC) is among the deadliest types of cancer globally. While early detection helps avert adverse outcomes, screening is only recommended for individuals at high risk, specifically those with familial and/or genetic predispositions. The objectives of this study are to systematically review primary studies on the cost-effectiveness of PC screening and to identify the critical factors that influence cost-effectiveness. This systematic review was performed using PRISMA guidelines. Economic evaluation studies on PC screening were identified from searches on the SCOPUS and PubMed databases. The quality of reporting of the selected articles was assessed according to CHEERS 2022. Using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, two reviewers conducted the title-abstract review, full-text review, and data extraction to select relevant articles. The authors' consensus was used to settle disagreements. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, measured by cost per quality-adjusted life year and cost per life year saved. Nine studies were selected for the final review. Most studies demonstrated that one-time screening for PC among high-risk individuals was cost-effective compared with no screening, while others found annual screening to also be cost-effective. High-risk was generally defined as having a >5% lifetime risk of PC and included individuals with either familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) or genetic susceptibility syndromes such as Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome, hereditary pancreatitis, hereditary non-polypoid colorectal cancer syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, and BRCA2 mutations. Individuals with new-onset diabetes (NOD) were also considered high-risk. Screening using mainly endoscopic ultrasound was cost-effective among FPC individuals and those with genetic syndromes. Risk-based screening was also cost-effective among patients with NOD. Screening for PC is cost-effective among selected high-risk individuals. However, cost-effectiveness depends on epidemiological factors, cost, the diagnostic performance of screening tools, and the overall design of studies.",

    "abstract": "Bone metastases are a major concern in cancer management since they significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality. Metastatic lesions, commonly arising from breast, prostate, lung, and kidney cancers, affect approximately 25% of cancer patients, leading to severe complications such as pain, fractures, and neurological deficits. This narrative review explores contemporary approaches to bone metastases, emphasizing a multidisciplinary strategy and the evolving concept of oligometastatic disease. Oligometastases, defined by limited metastatic spread (1-5 lesions), offer a potential window for curative treatment through aggressive interventions, including stereotactic ablative radiotherapy and resection surgery. Tumor boards, integrating systemic therapies with local interventions, are crucial to optimize treatment. Despite promising results, gaps remain in defining optimal treatment sequences and refining patient selection criteria. Future research should focus on personalized approaches, leveraging biomarkers and advanced imaging to enhance outcomes and the quality of life in patients with bone metastases.",

    "abstract": "Thyroid carcinomas are driven by diverse molecular alterations, but the tumor suppressor gene folliculin (<i>FLCN</i>), best known for its role in Birt-Hogg-Dub\u00e9 (BHD) syndrome, has received limited attention in thyroid tumors. Here, we describe two thyroid tumors with pathogenic <i>FLCN</i> alterations-one germline and one somatic-and analyze the broader prevalence and significance of <i>FLCN</i> in thyroid carcinomas using multiple large sequencing datasets, including ORIEN-AVATAR. Patient 1, with a germline <i>FLCN</i> mutation and a history of BHD syndrome, presented with a well-circumscribed oncocytic adenoma. Molecular testing confirmed biallelic <i>FLCN</i> inactivation, but no additional mutations or aggressive features were observed, and the patient remained disease-free post-thyroidectomy. Patient 2 harbored a somatic <i>FLCN</i> mutation in an oncocytic poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma, which exhibited extensive angioinvasion, high proliferative activity, and concurrent TP53 and RB1 mutations. The tumor progressed with metastatic disease despite multimodal treatment. Thyroid carcinomas revealed <i>FLCN</i> alterations in 1.1% of cases. Pathogenic mutations were rare but associated with oncocytic morphology, while homozygous deletions occurred more frequently in genomically unstable tumors, including anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. These findings suggest <i>FLCN</i> mutations may act as early oncogenic drivers in oncocytic thyroid neoplasms, while deletions represent secondary events in aggressive tumor evolution. The lack of <i>FLCN</i> coverage in standard thyroid molecular panels likely underestimates its clinical relevance. Including <i>FLCN</i> in genetic testing could improve tumor detection and characterization, particularly in BHD patients who may benefit from routine thyroid screening. Further studies are needed to clarify <i>FLCN</i>'s role in thyroid cancer pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The preoperative identification of occult pleural metastasis (OPM) in lung cancer remains a crucial clinical challenge. This study aimed to develop and validate a predictive model that integrates clinical information with chest CT radiomic features to preoperatively identify patients at risk of OPM. This study included 50 patients diagnosed with OPM during surgery as the positive training cohort and an equal number of nonmetastatic patients as the negative control cohort. Using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression, we identified key radiomic features and calculated radiomic scores. A predictive nomogram was developed by combining clinical characteristics and radiomic scores, which was subsequently validated with data from an additional 545 patients across three medical centers. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), the clinical T stage, and the tumor-pleural relationship were significant clinical predictors. The clinical model alone achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.761. The optimal integrated model, which combined radiomic scores from the volume of interest (VOI) with the CEA and NLR, demonstrated an improved predictive performance, with AUCs of 0.890 in the training cohort and 0.855 in the validation cohort. Radiomic features derived from CT scans show significant promise in identifying patients with lung cancer at risk of OPM. The nomogram developed in this study, which integrates CEA, the NLR, and radiomic tumor area scores, enhances the precision of preoperative OPM prediction and provides a valuable tool for clinical decision-making.",

    "title": "Primary Central Nervous System Tumors in Adolescents: A Population-Based Study on Epidemiology and Clinical Pathways in a Challenging Age Group.",
    "abstract": "Oncological care of adolescent patients is often inconsistent, as they frequently fall between pediatric and adult services. The Childhood Cancer Registry of Campania (CCRC) is the Italian largest population-based registry specializing in children 0-19 years old, with a target population of approximately 1.1 million inhabitants. This report presents epidemiological indicators and clinical pathways on primary brain tumors in adolescents (15-19 years) from the Campania region. Over the study period (2008-2020), the cohort included 219 adolescents with newly diagnosed central nervous system (CNS) tumors with an annual average incidence rate (IR) of 48.9 cases per million/year. The 5-year observed survival rate after diagnosis of CNS tumor was 84.8%. Overall, the most common tumor site was the pituitary gland and craniopharyngeal duct, representing 22.4% of all tumors. The most frequently occurring malignant primary CNS tumor was germinoma, while the most common non-malignant tumor was pituitary adenoma. Most patients were referred to adult services and nearly half migrated outside the region to receive cancer care. Challenges in the care of adolescent oncology patients include limited access to specialized care, difficulties in transitioning from pediatric to adult institutions, distinct tumor biology, and the underrepresentation of adolescents in clinical trials. The care of adolescents with CNS tumors is fragmented across institutions and significant variations in practice exist between adult and pediatric practitioners.",

    "abstract": "Many patients with head-and-neck cancer (HNC) suffer from speech or swallowing disorders. We investigated the impact of dysphagia on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), functioning, and distress in HNC survivors, and whether cancer rehabilitation can alleviate these conditions. Before admission (T0) and at discharge (T1) of three-week inpatient cancer rehabilitation, patient-reported outcomes were collected. HRQOL, symptoms, functioning, and psychological distress were assessed with EORTC QLQ-C30 and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaires. Of 63 HNC patients, 22 had dysphagia, 23 needed no speech therapy (Control-1), and 18 needed speech therapy, but showed no symptoms of dysphagia (Control-2). Before rehabilitation, HRQOL, physical, social, and emotional functioning were significantly lower in dysphagia patients than in controls. Dysphagia patients reported more severe general symptoms including fatigue, pain, sleep disturbances, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, and financial worries. Furthermore, the emotional and social functioning of Control-2 was significantly worse than Control-1. For all HNC patients, social, emotional, and role functioning, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, insomnia, and appetite loss significantly improved at T1. Improvements in HRQOL were most noticeable in dysphagia patients. Psychooncological counseling reduced depression in dysphagia and Control-2 patients to levels seen in the general population. In conclusion, dysphagia patients suffer severely from impaired functioning and systemic symptoms but benefit substantially from rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "Low-malignant-potential adenocarcinoma has been defined as a type of non-mucinous tumor, which has a total tumor size measuring \u2264 3 cm, exhibits \u2265 15% lepidic growth, lacks non-predominant high-grade patterns (\u226510% cribriform, \u22655% micropapillary, \u22655% solid), has an absence of angiolymphatic or visceral pleural invasion, spread through air spaces (STAS), necrosis and >1 mitosis per 2 mm<sup>2</sup>. The aim of this study is to validate, with regard to cancer-specific survival (CSS) and disease-free survival (DFS), the proposed definition of LMP adenocarcinoma in an independent external cohort of lung adenocarcinoma patients having undergone surgical resection, and having presented with a long follow-up period. Clinicopathological characteristics of patients who underwent lung resection for adenocarcinoma from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with ground-glass opacity (GGO) and part-solid tumors, minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), tumors \u22655 cm in size, nodal involvement and/or distant metastases, patients who underwent neoadjuvant treatment, and those who had an incomplete follow-up or a follow-up shorter than 60 months were excluded. The proposed criteria for low-malignant-potential adenocarcinoma (LMPA) were tumor size \u2264 3 cm, invasive size \u2265 0,5 cm, lepidic growth \u2265 15%, and absence of the following: mitosis (>1 per 2 mm<sup>2</sup>), mucinous subtype, angiolymphatic invasion, visceral pleural invasion, spread through air spaces (STAS) and tumor necrosis. End points were disease-free survival (DFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). The log-rank test was used to assess differences between subgroups. Out of 80 patients meeting the proposed criteria, 14 (17.5%) had the LMPA characteristics defined. The mean follow-up time was 67 \u00b1 39 months. A total of 19 patients died, all in the non-LMPA category, and 33 patients experienced recurrence: 4 (28.5%) with LMPA and 29 (43.9%) with non-LMPA. Log-rank analysis showed 100% 10-year CSS for patients with LMPA and 77.4% for patients without LMPA, with this difference being statistically significant (<i>p</i>-value = 0.047). Univariate analysis showed a significant association with the cStage (AJCC eighth edition), both for CSS (<i>p</i> value = 0.005) and DFS (<i>p</i>-value = 0.003). LMPA classification did not show a statistically significant impact on CSS and DFS, likely due to the limited number of events (CSS <i>p</i>-value = 0.232 and DFS <i>p</i>-value = 0.213). No statistical association was found for CSS and DFS with pT, the number of resected nodes (< or >10) or the number of resected N2 stations (< or >2). Our study confirmed the prognostic role of LMPA features, with a low risk of recurrence and a good CSS and DFS. The criteria for diagnosis are replicable and feasible for application. The clinical implications of these findings, such as pre-operative prediction and surveillance scheduling, may be the topic of future prospective studies.",

(4) Conclusions: Three observations support the idea that prior LNM gives rise to subsequent DM as the main pathway of dissemination in MCC. This implies that patients with nodal metastases should be considered for adjuvant systemic therapy studies as an enriched population. Participation in clinical trials is strongly encouraged.",

    "title": "The Relational Experience of Fear of Cancer Recurrence in Family Caregivers: A Reflexive Thematic Analysis Study.",
    "abstract": "Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) affects approximately 50% of family caregivers. While FCR in cancer patients has been well-documented, less is known about the experience of FCR in family caregivers. This study aimed to qualitatively explore the distinct characteristics of FCR in family caregivers. A focus group and semi-structured interviews were conducted via videoconferencing with family caregivers of cancer survivors (stages I-III, finished treatment, no recurrence). Participants were recruited through Canadian hospitals, community partners, and social media. The focus group and qualitative interviews explored family caregivers' experiences of FCR, including its content, frequency, impact, and management. A reflexive thematic analysis was used. In total, twenty family caregivers participated. Six participated in the focus group. Sixteen participated in the interviews. Two participated in both. Family caregivers described their experience of FCR as all-consuming, constant, and marked by a sense of helplessness. Qualitative analysis revealed a major theme of relational aspects of FCR in family caregivers, with the following four inter-related themes: patient-centric hypervigilance, self-silencing, FCR as isolating, and finding support. This qualitative study examined the experiences of family caregivers living with FCR. Our findings highlight that relational factors shape how family caregivers experience and manage their FCR. High-quality survivorship care should be redefined to include FCR interventions tailored to family caregivers.",

    "title": "Cancer Recurrence in Operated Primary Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients Seems to Be Independent of the Currently Available Postoperative Therapeutic Approach: A Retrospective Clinical Study.",
    "abstract": "Despite advances in treatment, recurrence rates in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remain high. Prognostic outcomes vary in terms of local recurrence, metastasis, and overall survival. A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted on OSCC patients who underwent primary surgery at the Department of Craniomaxillofacial and Facial Plastic Surgery, University Medical Center Frankfurt, between January 2014 and December 2020. Demographic data, tumor characteristics, surgical details, intraoperative frozen section results, and recurrence patterns were first assessed for availability. Subsequently, the available data relevant to each endpoint were analyzed. A total of 169 patients were analyzed (mean age: 64 years). The tongue was the most affected site and had the highest recurrence rate, followed by the floor of the mouth. Overall, 24.3% of patients experienced recurrence, with most cases occurring within the first year. T2 tumors had the highest recurrence rates. Between patients with and without adjuvant therapy, recurrence rates were comparable. Positive surgical margins were more common in recurrence cases, but no significant correlation was found between margin status and recurrence in patients without adjuvant therapy. Based on the analyzed data, achieving recurrence-free survival in OSCC does not solely depend on surgical technique or adjuvant therapy. Instead, early recognition of individual tumor characteristics and even tumor biology should guide personalized treatment planning. Notably, tumors of the tongue and floor of the mouth exhibited high recurrence rates regardless of disease stage, raising the question of whether primary chemoradiotherapy (CRT) could achieve better outcomes than surgery. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of CRT as a first-line treatment for OSCC in these locations.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive malignant brain tumor in adults, with an increasing incidence and a poor prognosis. Current challenges in glioblastoma management include rapid tumor growth, limited treatment effectiveness, high recurrence rates, and a significant impact on patients' quality of life. Given the complexity of glioblastoma care and recent advancements in diagnostic and treatment modalities, updated guidelines are needed in Canada. This Delphi study aimed to develop Canadian consensus recommendations for the diagnosis, classification, and management of newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma. A multidisciplinary panel of 14 Canadian experts in glioblastoma care was convened, and a comprehensive literature review was conducted to synthesize evidence and formulate initial recommendations. Consensus was achieved through three Delphi rounds, in which panelists rated their agreement with recommendation statements on a five-point Likert scale. Statements with \u226575% agreement were accepted, and others were revised for re-voting. Final recommendations were formulated based on the consensus level, strength of evidence, clinical expertise, and consideration of the Canadian healthcare context. These recommendations aim to standardize glioblastoma diagnosis and classification across Canada, provide evidence-based guidance for optimal treatment selection, integrate novel therapies, and enhance the overall quality of care for glioblastoma patients.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for the majority of the cases. Despite advancements in targeted therapies and immunotherapies, many patients still rely on chemotherapy, highlighting the need for innovative treatment strategies. Bispecific antibodies (bsAbs), which feature two distinct binding sites capable of targeting different antigens, have emerged as a promising therapeutic approach, particularly in combination with chemotherapy. This review explores the scientific evolution and clinical application of bsAbs in NSCLC, focusing on their synergistic potential with chemotherapy. BsAbs, such as amivantamab, which targets EGFR and MET, have demonstrated significant efficacy in clinical trials, particularly in patients with EGFR mutations. The combination of bsAbs with chemotherapy enhances immune-mediated tumor destruction by modulating the tumor microenvironment and overcoming resistance mechanisms. Recent clinical trials have shown improved progression-free survival and overall survival when bsAbs such as amivantamab are combined with chemotherapy, underscoring their potential to transform NSCLC treatment. Many other clinical trials are underway that are evaluating newer bsAbs, such as ivonescimab, which targets PD1 and VEGF. This review also discusses ongoing clinical trials investigating various bsAbs targeting EGFR, PD-1, PD-L1, HER2, and other pathways, highlighting the future directions of bsAb-based therapies. As the field evolves, bsAbs are poised to become a cornerstone of multimodal NSCLC treatment, offering more effective and personalized therapeutic options for patients with advanced disease.",

    "title": "Neuroendocrine Breast Cancer-Associated Ectopic Adrenocorticotropic Hormone Syndrome Requiring Bilateral Adrenalectomy.",
    "abstract": "Ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone syndrome (EAS) occurs when a tumor develops neuroendocrine differentiation with the secretion of ACTH resulting in hypercortisolism and possibly Cushing's syndrome (CS). Only 5-10% of CS cases are attributed to EAS; of these, breast tumors comprise less than 1%. Two known variants of breast neuroendocrine tumors include neuroendocrine-differentiated carcinoma and ductal carcinoma with neuroendocrine features. Currently, guidelines for treatment are limited and EAS is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. A 39-year-old female presented with a rapidly enlarging breast mass. Biopsy demonstrated invasive poorly differentiated breast carcinoma with high-grade neuroendocrine features and necrosis. Staging at diagnosis confirmed metastatic disease of the liver and bone. First-line chemotherapy (Cisplatin/Etoposide/Durvalumab) was initiated with evidence of disease progression after four cycles. Given a poor response to therapy, a simple mastectomy was performed for local control and complete pathologic analysis, demonstrating high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma with large-cell features. Second-line therapy (Adriamycin/Cyclophosphamide) was initiated for three cycles after which the patient required admission for severe and refractory hypokalemia. Workup confirmed elevated ACTH consistent with paraneoplastic EAS and further evidence of disease progression. Third-line therapy (Nab-Paclitaxel) was initiated, and genetic testing was completed, confirming the PIK3 mutation, for which access to Alpelisib therapy was requested. Given symptoms of progressive severe CS with significant liver disease limiting medical therapies, the patient underwent urgent bilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy after which she was able to be discharged home while awaiting additional systemic therapy. EAS resulting in CS secondary to breast neuroendocrine carcinoma is a rare and challenging diagnosis. Further research is needed to inform treatment guidelines to improve outcomes. While patient survival is dependent upon the underlying disease process, laparoscopic bilateral adrenalectomy is an accepted, definitive treatment option.",

    "abstract": "Biological sex and gender factors significantly influence the pathogenesis, progression, and treatment response in hematologic malignancies. This comprehensive review examines sex-specific differences in acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, and multiple myeloma through systematic analysis of the peer-reviewed literature published between 2014-2024 and identified through structured searches of PubMed, Web of Science, and MEDLINE databases. Epidemiological data demonstrate higher disease incidence (57% male vs. 43% female in MM, 63% male vs. 37% female in AML hospitalizations for ages 18-39) and inferior outcomes in male patients across malignancy types (5-year relative survival rates of 48.8% vs. 60.4% in females with AML), while female patients exhibit superior survival despite experiencing greater treatment-related toxicities. Our analysis reveals consistent sex-specific patterns in molecular mechanisms, including distinct mutational profiles, differences in immune system function, and sex-based pharmacokinetic variations that collectively suggest the necessity for sex-differentiated treatment approaches. The review identifies reproducible patterns across diseases, particularly in cytogenetic and molecular characteristics, with females demonstrating favorable prognostic mutations in leukemias and higher rates of chromosomal abnormalities in multiple myeloma. Despite these identifiable patterns, significant knowledge gaps persist regarding the underlying mechanisms of sex-based outcome differences. Incorporating sex and gender considerations into precision medicine frameworks represents a critical advancement toward optimizing treatment strategies and improving clinical outcomes for patients with hematologic malignancies.",

    "abstract": "Neuropilin-1 (NRP1), initially identified as a neuronal guidance protein, has emerged as a multifaceted regulator in cancer biology. Beyond its role in axonal guidance and angiogenesis, NRP1 is increasingly recognized for its significant impact on tumor progression and therapeutic outcomes. This review explores the diverse functions of NRP1 in cancer, encompassing its influence on tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis. NRP1 interacts with several key signaling pathways, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), semaphorins, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2), modulating the tumor microenvironment and promoting angiogenesis. Moreover, NRP1 expression correlates with poor prognosis in various malignancies, underscoring its potential as a prognostic biomarker. Therapeutically, targeting NRP1 holds promise as a novel strategy to inhibit tumor growth and enhance the efficacy of regular treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Strategies involving NRP1-targeted therapies, including monoclonal antibodies, small molecule inhibitors, and gene silencing techniques, are being actively investigated in preclinical and clinical settings. Despite challenges in specificity and delivery, advances in understanding NRP1 biology offer new avenues for personalized cancer therapy. Although several types of cancer cells can express NRPs, the role of NRPs in tumor pathogenesis is largely unknown. Future investigations are needed to enhance our understanding of the effects and mechanisms of NRPs on the proliferation, apoptosis, and migration of neuronal, endothelial, and cancer cells. The novel frameworks or multi-omics approaches integrate data from multiple databases to better understand cancer's molecular and clinical features, develop personalized therapies, and help identify biomarkers. This review highlights the pivotal role of NRP1 in cancer pathogenesis and discusses its implications for developing targeted therapeutic approaches to improve patient outcomes, highlighting the role of OMICS in targeting cancer patients for personalized therapy.",

    "abstract": "Biliary tract cancers (BTC) comprise a heterogeneous group of malignancies, including gallbladder cancer, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The main determinants of prognosis in BTC are the stage of the disease and the eligibility for curative treatment. Additionally, liver functional capacity is also one of the factors influencing survival in biliary tract cancers. The age-bilirubin-INR-creatinine (ABIC) score has been previously shown to predict prognosis in hepatic diseases. The aim of our study is to demonstrate the relationship between the ABIC score and prognosis in BTC. In this study, a retrospective analysis was performed on 41 patients with non-metastatic BTC and 73 patients with metastatic BTC who were followed up in our clinic between 2003 and 2025. All patients were \u226518 years old at the time of diagnosis, and BTC was pathologically confirmed. The ABIC score was calculated separately for each group. A threshold value for the ABIC score was determined using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, and based on this threshold, patients were divided into low and high ABIC score groups. Both the relationship between the ABIC score and prognosis and the other factors affecting prognosis were investigated. In the non-metastatic BTC group, the cutoff value for the ABIC score was 6.89. The median survival time of patients with a high ABIC score was significantly shorter. In the metastatic BTC group, the cutoff value for the ABIC score was 7.41. Similarly, in this group, patients with a high ABIC score had a significantly shorter median survival time. Additionally, in the non-metastatic BTC group, tumor localization and stage were prognostic factors affecting survival, while in the metastatic BTC group, CEA and first-line chemotherapy were the prognostic factors influencing overall survival. <b>Conclusions:</b> We demonstrate that the ABIC score is a prognostic factor determining median survival in both non-metastatic and metastatic BTC patients.",

Patients with biopsy-proven cases of osteosarcoma were identified from 2000-2021. Statistical analysis was completed using SPSS version 29.0.2 and included chi-squared, Kaplan-Meier and log-rank, and stepwise Cox regressions. Statistical significance was considered at <i>p</i> < 0.05. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed no significant differences in 5- and 10-year DSS between rural (55.0% and 47.0%) and urban patients (56.0% and 51.0%) (<i>p</i> = 0.107). Multivariable analysis further revealed no significant DSS difference between rural and urban patients (aHR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.86-1.24; <i>p</i> = 0.757). This study expands upon prior research by investigating DSS between rural and urban osteosarcoma patients and finding no significant differences. While rural living is often associated with worse outcomes, important prognostic factors for osteosarcoma, including metastatic disease at presentation and tumor grade, were not significantly different between rural and urban patients in our study, possibly explaining our DSS-related findings.

The objective of this study is to understand how oncology care providers (OCPs), family/friend caregivers, and health system decision makers can include conversations of PA into care for those living with a GB. We conducted 19 semi-structured interviews guided by the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) model and further refined them by the theoretical domains framework (TDF). The data were then analyzed using a directed content analysis using a codebook generated using the TDF. Patients and family/friend caregivers appreciated hearing about PA from their OCPs, from initial diagnosis into follow-up appointments, and they saw PA as a way to take a break from cancer/medically focused care, and historical PA behaviours did not mean patients were more or less likely to be open about PA discussions. This study further emphasises the inclusion of PA discussions in clinical care. OCPs in GB care feel they have the knowledge to partake in PA conversations, and GB patients are open to having these conversations. However, specific barriers are in place that do not lead to widespread implementation of PA discussions for all patients.",

    "abstract": "There is still an unmet need for the treatment of high-risk hematological malignancies. To date, allogeneic stem cell transplantation remains the only chance of cure. Most patients suffering from high-risk hematological malignancies are of an older age and often present with comorbidities. Moreover, patients achieving remission often suffer from early relapse. Amongst the different treatment options, sequential conditioning has yet to prove its value against other conditioning regimens. Sequential conditioning relies on a short course of intensive chemotherapy that is quickly followed by immunosuppressive conditioning before allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Here, we will try to determine which patients can benefit from sequential conditioning. Amongst the different sequential regimens, we will also try to assess if one regimen is better than all the others. Despite the several studies conducted on sequential conditioning, very few are prospective work and head-to-head comparisons are almost inexistant. Sequential conditioning also relies on the use of prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusion post-transplantation. Hence, limiting non-relapse complications is of primary importance to the allow administration of post-transplant treatment. In the era of new targeting therapies, is there still a place for sequential conditioning? Can patients benefit from an association of new therapeutic agents and sequential conditioning?",

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify the pooled incidence of cirAEs in this population and strengthen clinical awareness for early recognition and management. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, CBM, CNKI, and Wanfang databases was conducted from inception to December 2022. Literature that reported the incidence of cirAEs in patients with lung cancer receiving ICIs therapy was included. A meta-analysis was conducted using R software, version 4.4.1 to estimate the pooled incidence of cirAEs, and a random-effects model was used for data synthesis. Begg's rank correlation and funnel plots were used to assess publication bias. A total of 99 articles involving 23,814 patients with lung cancer receiving ICIs therapy were included, with publication dates ranging from 2012 to 2022. The meta-analysis results reveal that the incidence of cirAEs in patients with lung cancer was 20.26% (95% confidence interval [CI (17.12-23.81)]. Significant differences were observed between all subgroups, including continent, study type, combination therapy, dual ICIs therapy, and diagnostic criteria for cirAEs for Grade 1-2 and Grade 3-4 incidences. The incidence of cirAEs in patients with lung cancer is relatively high, particularly undergoing combined or dual ICIs therapy. To comprehensively characterize cirAEs in patients with lung cancer, large-scale multicenter studies integrating real-world pharmacovigilance data are warranted to establish precise incidence estimates and identify clinically significant risk factors. This review's insights aroused clinical staff's attention and concern about cirAEs, potentially enhancing the quality of life of patients with cancer.",

In a retrospective multicenter study of 507 NAC-treated patients (training cohort: 357; validation cohort: 150), independent predictors of pCR were identified through univariate and multivariate logistic regression. A nomogram was constructed and validated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) evaluated the improvement in performance after incorporating the PIV indicator. The high PIV patients (cutoff: 316.533) had significantly lower pCR rates than the low PIV patients (<i>p</i> < 0.001).

    "title": "Recurrent Metastatic Basal Cell Carcinomas of the Face in a Patient with Gorlin-Goltz Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Gorlin-Goltz syndrome, also known as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS), is a rare, inherited autosomal dominant disorder primarily caused by mutations in the <i>PTCH1</i> gene, which regulates the Hedgehog signaling pathway. This genetic defect leads to the uncontrolled proliferation of basal cells, resulting in the formation of multiple basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and odontogenic keratocysts (OKCs). This study aims to present a complex clinical case of a patient with Gorlin-Goltz syndrome who developed multiple recurrent metastatic basal cell carcinomas on the facial region, detailing the multidisciplinary treatment strategies employed and the challenges encountered during the management of the disease. The patient, diagnosed with a pathogenic <i>PTCH1</i> gene mutation, underwent a series of treatment interventions over several years. These included multiple surgical excisions aimed at tumor removal, diverse radiotherapy approaches for residual or inoperable lesions, and systemic targeted therapy with Hedgehog pathway inhibitors to control tumor progression. The recurrent and aggressive nature of the basal cell carcinomas resulted in extensive facial tissue loss, posing significant challenges for radical tumor excision and subsequent reconstructive procedures. Multimodal therapeutic strategies, including Mohs micrographic surgery for precise tumor clearance and targeted systemic therapy with vismodegib, were implemented. However, the aggressive progression of lesions required ongoing surgical interventions, highlighting the limitations of current treatment modalities in achieving long-term disease control. This case underscores the critical need for a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to managing Gorlin-Goltz syndrome. Successful management requires close collaboration between dermatologists, oncologists, maxillofacial surgeons, and plastic surgeons to balance effective tumor control with optimal functional and aesthetic outcomes. The integration of advanced surgical techniques and targeted molecular therapies shows promise in improving patient outcomes. Nonetheless, early diagnosis, rigorous follow-up, and patient education remain essential components in minimizing disease progression and enhancing the quality of life for affected individuals.",

    "title": "New Therapeutic Scenarios in the Context of Adjuvant Treatment for HR+/HER2-Breast Cancer: The Possible Role of Ribociclib in Treatment Algorithms for Stage II and III.",
    "abstract": "Early breast cancer (EBC) treatment has evolved from radical surgery to a multidisciplinary approach, integrating radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and hormone therapy with surgery to ensure the best possible outcome. Despite these advancements, hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Negative (HER2-) EBC still faces high recurrence rates after endocrine therapy. A panel of oncologists from Central-Southern Italy discussed the profile of ribociclib as an adjuvant therapy, based on the results of the NATALEE study, focusing on efficacy, safety, patient profiles, and regional challenges in treatment access. The experts identified ribociclib as suitable adjuvant treatment for stage II and III HR+/HER2- EBC patients, including those without lymph node involvement but with biologically aggressive disease. In their view, ribociclib could be an interesting option for patients not eligible for chemotherapy due to contraindications. Key challenges in translating the evidence on ribociclib in EBC into clinical practice include treatment duration, patient follow-up, and adverse events management. Strategies to address these challenges range from telemedicine and support from local clinics to tailored communication to improve adherence. Ribociclib is expected to significantly impact adjuvant treatment for HR+/HER2- EBC by addressing broader patient needs and potentially improving long-term outcomes through enhanced adherence and personalized management strategies.",

    "abstract": "Treatment resistance due to gene alterations remains a challenge for patients with EGFR-mutated advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (a/mNSCLC). A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to describe resistance mutation profiles and their impact on clinical outcomes in adults with a/mNSCLC in the United States (US). A comprehensive search of MEDLINE and Embase (2018-August 2022) identified 2986 records. Among 45 included studies, osimertinib was the most commonly reported treatment (osimertinib alone: 15 studies; as one of the treatment options: 18 studies), followed by other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs; 5 studies) and non-TKIs (1 study). For first-line (1L) and second-line (2L) osimertinib, the most frequent EGFR-dependent resistance mechanisms were T790M loss (1L: 15.4%; 2L: 20.5-49%) and C797X mutation (1L: 2.9-12.5%; 2L: 1.4-22%). EGFR-independent mechanisms included MET amplification (1L: 0.6-66%; 2L: 7.2-19%), TP53 mutation (1L: 29.2-33.3%), and CCNE1 amplification (1L: 7.9%; 2L: 10.3%). For patients receiving osimertinib, EGFR T790M mutation loss, EGFR/MET/HER2 amplification, RET fusion, and PIK3CA mutation were associated with worse progression-free survival. Resistance mechanisms resulting from current NSCLC treatments in the US are complex, underscoring the need to address such heterogeneous resistance profiles and improve outcomes for patients with EGFR-mutated a/mNSCLC.",

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> The survival rate among stomach adenocarcinoma patients is exceedingly low. NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin) has pivotal roles in cell proliferation, immunity, and tumorigenesis. KIM-1 (Kidney Injury Molecule-1), also referred to as TIM-1 and HAVcr-1, is a transmembrane glycoprotein located in healthy immune cells and epithelial cells, and its upregulated form is generally found in several human cancers. <b>Aim:</b> The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance of the expression of KIM-1 and NGAL in stomach cancers and identify NGAL-positive inflammatory cells in the tumor microenvironment. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> We immunohistochemically evaluated the expression of NGAL and KIM1 in 172 cases of stomach adenocarcinomas. <b>Result:</b> The mean age of the patients was 64.07 \u00b1 12.35 years, and the mean and median follow-up period were 25.5 and 20.3 months, respectively. The expression rates of KIM-1 and NGAL in tumor cells were identical at 31.4% (n = 54). In 27 of these cases, both proteins were present. Among the deceased patients, the rate of simultaneous KIM-1 and NGAL positivity was relatively higher (<i>p</i> = 0.041). NGAL-positive inflammatory cells were observed in 13.4% of cases, with no significant correlation between these cells and survival times (<i>p</i> = 0.497). However, there was a negative correlation between survival times and KIM-1 (<i>p</i> = 0.037) and NGAL (<i>p</i> = 0.016) expressions in tumor cells. <b>Conclusions:</b> The present study has shown that KIM-1- and NGAL-positive tumor cells are influential in gastric tumorigenesis. Given the progress in anti-KIM-1 therapy, the presence of KIM-1 expression could contribute to the development of new treatment options for aggressive gastric cancer. However, these discoveries need to be validated in larger-scale studies.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of trilaciclib in preventing myelosuppression in patients with esophageal cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Based on the use of trilaciclib, 81 patients were divided into a primary prevention group (PP group, n = 49) and a secondary prevention group (SP group, n = 32). The incidence of myelosuppression, antibiotic usage rate, survival outcomes, and other treatment-related toxicities were analyzed using chi-square tests and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The incidence of chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression in the SP group was significantly higher than that in the PP group (96.9% vs. 79.6%), with a significantly higher proportion of grade III and above events (37.6% vs. 8.2%, <i>p</i> < 0.05). For chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, the incidence of grade III/IV events in the SP group was significantly higher than in the PP group (28.1% vs. 8.2%, <i>p</i> = 0.017). Additionally, the SP group experienced higher rates and severity of chemotherapy-induced anemia and thrombocytopenia. The PP group provided better protection against grade III/IV leukopenia and neutropenia (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Non-hematological toxicities and efficacy outcomes were similar between groups (<i>p</i> > 0.05). The study is the first to demonstrate that trilaciclib is a safe and effective option for the prevention of myelosuppression in esophageal cancer patients.",

The analysis included 165 patients who underwent thyroid nodule surgery at Ankara Numune Training and Research Hospital. Data on demographics, surgical procedures, ultrasonographic features, and pathology results were extracted and analyzed. The cohort consisted predominantly of women (79.39%) with a mean age of 46.68 years. Surgeries performed included total thyroidectomy (88%), total thyroidectomy with central lymph node dissection (6%), and modified radical neck dissection (3%). Malignancies, largely papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), were identified in 81 cases. Univariate analysis revealed significant associations between malignancy and ultrasonographic features like calcification, spiculated margins, and nuclear inclusions. Multivariate analysis pinpointed calcification as the only independent risk factor. Histopathological findings indicated heterogeneity within malignancies, noting lymphovascular and capsular invasion in PTC cases. These findings emphasize calcification as a key predictor of malignancy in AUS thyroid nodules and underscore the role of surgical intervention in this challenging diagnostic category, contributing to enhanced risk stratification and clinical decision-making for managing AUS/FLUS thyroid nodules.",

Pre-operative nutritional decline and weight are linked with poorer patient outcomes. This study retrospectively analyzed the impact of peri-operative nutritional status (as assessed by patient-generated subjective global assessment, PG-SGA), and weight loss on the survival of patients undergoing curative surgery for GOC (2013 to 2022). Of the 148 patients who underwent surgery, PG-SGA and weight data were available for 107 (72%) and 121 (82%), respectively. At presentation, 44% (<i>n</i> = 47) of patients were well nourished, dropping to 17% (<i>n</i> = 18) post-operatively.

    "abstract": "Pediatric primary brain tumors pose significant therapeutic challenges due to their aggressive nature and the critical environment of the developing brain. Traditional modalities like surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy often achieve limited success in high-grade gliomas and embryonal tumors. Tumor-treating fields (TTfields), a non-invasive therapy delivering alternating electric fields, has emerged as a promising approach to disrupt tumor cell division through mechanisms such as mitotic disruption, DNA damage, and tumor microenvironment modulation. TTfields are thought to selectively target dividing tumor cells while sparing healthy, non-dividing cells. While TTfields therapy is FDA-approved for the management of glioblastoma and other cancers, its application in pediatric brain tumors remains under investigation. Preclinical studies reveal its potential in medulloblastoma and ependymoma models, while observational data suggest its safety and feasibility in children. Current research focuses on optimizing TTfields' efficacy through advanced technologies, including high-intensity arrays, skull remodeling, and integration with immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. Innovative device-based therapies like magnetic field-based technologies further expand the treatment possibilities. As clinical trials progress, TTfields and related modalities offer hope for addressing unmet needs in pediatric neuro-oncology, especially for tumors in challenging locations. Future directions include biomarker identification, tailored protocols, and novel therapeutic combinations to enhance outcomes in pediatric brain tumor management.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which circulate in the serum and plasma, play a role in several biological processes, and their levels in body fluids are associated with the pathogenesis of various diseases, including different types of cancer. For this reason, miRNAs are considered promising candidates as biomarkers for diagnostic purposes, enabling the early detection of pathological onset and monitoring drug responses during therapy. However, current methods for miRNA quantification, such as northern blotting, isothermal amplification, RT-PCR, microarrays, and next-generation sequencing, are limited by their reliance on centralized laboratories, high costs, and the need for specialized personnel. Consequently, the development of sensitive, simple, and one-step analytical techniques for miRNA detection is highly desirable, particularly given the importance of early diagnosis and prompt treatment in cases of cancer. Lateral flow assays (LFAs) are among the most attractive point-of-care (POC) devices for healthcare applications. These systems allow for the rapid and straightforward detection of analytes using low-cost setups that are accessible to a wide audience.

    "abstract": "Cancer remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Its complex pathogenesis and metastasis pose significant challenges for early diagnosis, underscoring the urgent need for innovative and non-invasive tumor screening methods. Exosomes, small extracellular vesicles that reflect the physiological and pathological states of their parent cells, are uniquely suited for cancer liquid biopsy due to their molecular cargo, including RNA, DNA, and proteins. However, traditional methods for exosome isolation and detection are often limited by inadequate sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency. Nanopore technology, characterized by high sensitivity and single-molecule resolution, offers powerful tools for exosome analysis. This review highlights its diverse applications in tumor screening, such as magnetic nanopores for high-throughput sorting, electrochemical sensing for real-time detection, nanomaterial-based assemblies for efficient capture, and plasmon resonance for ultrasensitive analysis. These advancements have enabled precise exosome detection and demonstrated promising potential in the early diagnosis of breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancers, while also supporting personalized treatment strategies. Additionally, this review summarizes commercialized products for exosome-based cancer diagnostics and examines the technical and translational challenges in clinical applications. Finally, it discusses the future prospects of nanopore technology in advancing liquid biopsy toward clinical implementation.

Fifteen mice, germline heterozygous for <i>Men1</i>(+/T), were treated with subcutaneous injections of lanreotide autogel (Somatuline Autogel<sup>\u00ae</sup>, IPSEN Pharma), while 15 mice were treated with subcutaneous injections of physiologic sodium chloride as the control group. Five mice from each group were euthanized after 12, 15, and 18 months, respectively. The complete lungs were resected and evaluated after hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry for synaptophysin and chromogranin A. In the lungs of the 30 evaluated mice, whether treated or placebo treated, no bronchopulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia nor neuroendocrine neoplasia was detected through histopathology. However, pulmonary adenocarcinoma developed in 2 (13%) of the 15 untreated mice and in 1 (7%) of the 15 lanreotide-treated mice. Heterozygous <i>Men1</i>(+/T) knockout mice do not develop bronchopulmonary NEN or precursor lesions, but pulmonary adenocarcinoma. This surprising result needs to be investigated in more detail.",

    "abstract": "When novel biomarkers are developed for the clinical management of patients diagnosed with cancer, it is critical to quantify the accuracy of a biomarker-based decision tool. The evaluation can be challenging when the definite outcome <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow> <annotation>$$ T $$</annotation></semantics> </math> , such as time to disease progression, is only partially ascertained on a limited set of study patients. Under settings where <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow> <annotation>$$ T $$</annotation></semantics> </math> is only observed on a subset but an auxiliary outcome correlated with <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow> <annotation>$$ T $$</annotation></semantics> </math> is available on all subjects, we propose an augmented estimation procedure for commonly used time-dependent accuracy measures. The augmented estimators are easy to implement without imposing modeling assumptions between the two types of time-to-event outcomes and are more efficient than the complete-case estimator. When the ascertainment of the outcome is non-random and subject to informative censoring, we further augment our proposed method with inverse probability weighting to improve robustness. Results from simulation studies confirm the robustness and efficiency properties of the proposed estimators. The method is illustrated with data from the Canary Prostate Active Surveillance Study.",

    "title": "Decoding the role of lipid metabolism in NSCLC: From macrophage subtype identification to prognostic model development.",
    "abstract": "Lipid metabolism plays a pivotal role in shaping the tumor microenvironment, particularly by influencing macrophage function. This study aimed to identify lipid-associated macrophage (LAM) marker genes involved in the onset and progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) through integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-seq) analyses. Mutation and RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases were analyzed to explore the relationship between lipid metabolism pathways and NSCLC progression. scRNA-seq analysis revealed macrophage subtypes closely associated with lipid metabolism, with three key marker genes-S100A10, HLA-DMB, and CTSL-identified as predictive factors for patient prognosis. A prognostic risk scoring model was constructed and validated using survival analysis and ROC curves, demonstrating high accuracy in stratifying NSCLC patients by risk. Further in\u00a0vivo experiments using subcutaneous tumor xenografts and lung metastasis models showed that S100A10 and CTSL promoted tumor growth and metastasis, while HLA-DMB inhibited these processes. Immune infiltration analysis highlighted the immunological relevance of the identified marker genes, providing insights into their functional roles. This study underscores the critical influence of LAMs in NSCLC progression and highlights a robust prognostic model that offers potential therapeutic targets for improving patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is believed to be triggered by a dysregulated inflammatory response to the intestinal microbiota. Acyloxyacyl hydrolase (AOAH) is a unique host lipase that inactivates Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). After finding that AOAH produced in the intestine decreases stimulatory LPS levels in colon contents, we used the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model to test the enzyme's ability to prevent colitis in mice. We found that AOAH played a protective role by decreasing colonic inflammation, tissue injury, and barrier permeability. Increasing or decreasing intestinal LPS abundance exacerbated or alleviated colitis, respectively, suggesting that AOAH prevents colitis by reducing stimulatory intestinal LPS levels. AOAH also mitigated colitis-associated colorectal cancer. This highly conserved enzyme may exert its protective effects by preventing LPS-induced injury to the epithelial cell mitochondria that are important for restoring the mucosal epithelial barrier after injury. By decreasing intestinal levels of stimulatory LPS, AOAH prevents colitis and colorectal cancer.",

    "abstract": "Proline-rich transmembrane protein 4 (PRRT4) has been infrequently studied, with limited literature suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker for gastric cancer. This study aims to investigate the prognostic value of the PRRT4 gene in pan-cancer. We acquired and analyzed data from several platforms, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype Tissue Expression Project (GTEx), Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), cBioPortal, HPA, and TIMER 2.0. In addition, we have further analyzed the data using multivariate analyzes and RT-qPCR. In vitro experiments were performed to detect the proliferation and apoptosis of AML cells before and after PRRT4 knockdown. PRRT4 exhibited low expression in 10 types of cancers and high expression in 3 types, and this expression was significantly correlated with tumor stage, age, and gender across various cancer types. PRRT4, identified as a potential independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) in several cancers including LAML, PAAD, SKCM, STAD, THYM, and UVM, and exhibited a high frequency of mutation in UCEC. Moreover, PRRT4 was found to be correlated with DNA methylation and immune infiltration in various cancers. Ultimately, in the multivariate analysis model, PRRT4 was discerned as an independent prognostic biomarker for AML, predicated on the statistics based from our institution. After PRRT4 knockdown, the proliferation ability of THP1 cells was significantly enhanced, and the apoptosis ratio was significantly decreased. PRRT4 may serve as a potential therapeutic target and prognostic marker for various malignancies.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GB) cells actively interact with the central nervous system (CNS) tumor microenvironment (TME). These interactions, particularly with neurons, require a better understanding. 3D tumor models replicating the human TME are needed to unravel pathological processes and to test novel treatments for efficacy and safety. We developed a novel 3D human coculture model for studying neuron-GB interactions. The model revealed both structural and functional interactions between cell types. Paracrine communication in the coculture model favored a tumor-supportive environment. Notably, cell-specific calcium signaling characteristics differed in cocultures compared to monocultures, highlighting the impact of interactions on cellular functionality in TME. The safety of a clinically used treatment, temozolomide, was tested in the 3D coculture model, and it selectively inhibited GB invasion while preserving neurons' morphology and functionality. The established model provides a tool for dissecting the interactions within the TME and testing the efficacy and safety of novel treatments.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the value of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) for prognostic value for long-term PFS in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). A cohort of 295 NPC patients underwent pretreatment 3.0T MRI with DKI to derive mean kurtosis (MK), mean diffusion (MD), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Clinical parameters (Tumor stage, EBV-DNA, neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens) were recorded. Follow-up extended to December 2023. Statistical analyses (R software v4.3.0) included univariate/multivariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. A prognostic nomogram integrating key predictors was developed. Median 10-year follow-up revealed 2-, 5-, and 10-year PFS rates of 89%, 79%, and 74%, respectively. Univariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that T stage, Clinical Stages, NAC regimens, ADC_Group, MK_Group, and MD_Group were significant prognostic factors for PFS in NPC (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Multivariate analysis identified Clinical Stage (HR\u2009=\u20092.230, 95% CI 1.44-3.66, p\u2009<\u20090.001), NAC (neoadjuvant chemotherapy) regimens (HR\u2009=\u20090.56, 95% CI 0.35-0.90, p\u2009=\u20090.017), and MK_Group (HR\u2009=\u20090.52, 95% CI 0.33-0.82, p\u2009=\u20090.003) as independent prognostic factors.

The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic performance of rapid CLIA tests in IA. Patient group consisted of 17 patients who were diagnosed with probable IA according to EORTC/MSG criteria. Patients without invasive fungal infection (IFI) were defined as the control group, whereas healthy volunteers were also included. A total of 93 serum samples were used in this study. Platelia Aspergillus Ag test and Dynamiker Aspergillus Ag Kit, CLIA tests Aspergillus Galactomannan Detection Kit and Fungus (1-3) \ua7b5-D-Glucan Detection Kit, were used. Specificity, sensitivity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the overall diagnostic performance of CLIA tests comparing FDA-approved GM ELISA test. The sensitivity of the CLIA galactomannan (CLIA GM) test was 70.6%, specificity 92.1%, PPV 66.7% and NPV 93.3% (p\u2009<\u20090.001), while the sensitivity of the CLIA beta-glucan (CLIA BDG) test was 88.2%, specificity 81.6%, PPV 51.7% and NPV 96.9% (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Using the PlateliaTM Aspergillus Ag Test as the reference method, the areas under the curve (AUC) of the ROC curve were 0.878 for CLIA BDG and 0.869 for CLIA GM. CLIA-based tests were evaluated as being rapid diagnostic tests for IA since their NPVs were found to be very high.

A total of 161 patients with advanced NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations, who received first-line treatment at Shanghai Chest Hospital between July 2017 and July 2023, were enrolled in this study. Among them, 78 patients were treated with a combination of first-generation EGFR-TKIs and bevacizumab (7.5\u2009mg/kg), constituting the bevacizumab plus TKI (A\u2009+\u2009T) group. The remaining 83 patients received osimertinib monotherapy (80\u2009mg daily), forming the osimertinib group. The objective response rate (ORR) was 65.4% (51/78) in the A\u2009+\u2009T group and 68.7% (57/83) in the osimertinib group (<i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.657).

    "abstract": "Newly or already diagnosed cancer might significantly influence the clinical presentation, outcome, and therapy of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Out of 1745 patients with acute PE, 66 patients were diagnosed with cancer during an initial hospitalization due to acute PE (where PE was the first clinical manifestation of cancer), 165 patients had known cancer treated in the last 6\u2009months, and 1514 patients had acute PE without known or suspected cancer. The primary end-point of the present study was all-cause hospital death. The secondary end-points were the proportion of patients treated with thrombolysis and who had severe disease, and the ocurrence of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. Patients with PE as the first presentation of cancer had the highest hospital mortality rate compared to the other two groups (HR for the mortality rate in patients without cancer as a reference, adjusted to four-stratum mortality risk, and Charlson's comorbidity index was 3.440; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.795-6.591; p\u2009<\u20090.001). Patients with known cancer before PE had a significantly lower chance of being treated with thrombolysis than patients without cancer (OR, 0.523; 95% CI, 0.339-0.807; p\u2009=\u20090.003); additionally, this difference was attenuated but remained when the OR was adjusted to age (OR, 0.542; 95% CI, 0.351-0.838; p\u2009=\u20090.006). Patients with known cancer had a higher frequency of high-risk PE compared with patients without cancer (18.2% vs. 12.8%; p\u2009<\u20090.001). Patients with PE as the first manifestation of cancer had a higher frequency of intermediate-high-risk PE than those without (36.4% vs. 30.9%; p\u2009<\u20090.001). There was no significant difference in bleeding during hospitalization between groups. Patients with cancer had a more severe presentation of acute PE than patients without.

    "abstract": "Perineal wound complications (PWCs) occur in 15-30% of patients after abdominoperineal excision (APE) and are associated with adverse events, such as delayed wound healing, prolonged hospitalization, a delay in initiating postoperative chemotherapy, and decreased quality of life. Preoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy are risk factors for wound complications. It is unknown whether total neoadjuvant treatment (TNT) affects the risk of PWCs compared with chemoradiotherapy (CRT). This study compared patients from the experimental (EXP; short-course radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgery as TNT) and standard-of-care (STD; CRT, surgery, and postoperative chemotherapy depending on hospital policy) treatment arms of the RAPIDO trial who underwent APE within 6 months after preoperative treatment. The primary outcome was the incidence of PWCs (infection, abscess, dehiscence, wound discharge, presacral abscess affecting the perineum) of any grade \u2264 30 days after APE. Secondary outcomes were the incidence of PWCs >30 days after APE, length of hospital stay, characteristics associated with PWCs, and oncological outcomes in patients with versus without PWC. Of the 901 patients who started treatment (460 in EXP arm, 441 in STD arm), 153 (33%) and 160 (36%) underwent APE after TNT and CRT, respectively. After TNT and CRT, the incidence of PWCs \u226430 days after APE, readmission, and reoperation was 54 of 153 (35%) versus 53 of 160 (33%) (P = 0.69), 9% versus 12% (P = 0.54), and 7% versus 8% (P = 0.75), respectively.

Univariable analysis revealed that pretreatment albumin <35\u2005g/l, hypertension, and haemoglobin \u2264 8.0\u2005mmol/l were associated with PWC. Oncological outcomes were similar between patients with and without PWCs.

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence connects gallstone disease (GSD) to all types of cancer incidence; however, the results were inconsistent. The present study aimed to evaluate whether and to what extent these associations exist comprehensively. We systematically searched published longitudinal studies indexed in PubMed and Embase database from dates of inception to March 31, 2020. We pooled the effect of GSD on all-cause cancer incidence. Moreover, we further employed stratified analysis concerning sex, geographic background, surgery status, and follow-up period. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was applied to decide whether the included sample size was sufficient for evaluating these associations. Fifty-one studies incorporating over 13 million participants were eligible for analysis in this study. GSD pose an increased risk of all-cause cancer risk (pooled RR\u2009=\u20091.43; 95% CI: 1.33-1.54) compared with the healthy controls, especially hematologic malignancy (pooled RR\u2009=\u20091.14; 95% CI: 1.05-1.25), gastrointestinal cancers (pooled RR\u2009=\u20091.28; 95% CI: 1.15-1.41), liver, pancreas, and biliary tract cancer (pooled RR\u2009=\u20091.84; 95% CI: 1.62-2.10), and kidney cancer (pooled RR\u2009=\u20091.19; 95% CI: 1.03-1.37). These associations are not markedly changed after stratification by different subgroups. Moreover, the TSA confirmed the sample size was sufficient to draw these conclusive conclusions. The present meta-analysis with sufficient evidence indicates GSD increases the risk for all causes of cancer incidence. The evidence may warrant GSD patients to perform screening and prophylactic treatment for the prevention of these complications. The indication for cholecystectomy should be determined through a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's clinical presentation, with a thorough assessment of the potential therapeutic benefits and surgical risks.",

This paper presents a rare case of an 82-year-old woman with PG-DLBCL who experienced SR without treatment, followed by a short-term relapse. In the present case, the most likely mechanism was biopsy-induced ischemia and increased apoptosis. This case underscores that, in PG-DLBCL with SR, the initial endoscopic findings are the most critical reference for an accurate diagnosis and proper management, but careful long-term follow-up and monitoring are necessary, given the risk of relapse.",

A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at the University Medical Center, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Patients aged 18-49 years who underwent a colonoscopy and were diagnosed with colorectal neoplasia were included. The prevalence of colorectal neoplasia was analyzed across three age groups: 18-29, 30-39, and 40-49 years. This study included 1,696 patients (52.9% male) with a median age of 41 years. The prevalence of colorectal neoplasia and advanced colorectal neoplasia was 13% and 3.7%, respectively. The prevalence of colorectal neoplasia increased significantly with age: 4.1% in the 18-29 age group, 9.9% in 30-39, and 16.6% in 40-49 (p<0.01). Adenomas were more prevalent than serrated polyps (10.7% vs. 0.5%, p<0.01), and the incidence increased with age (3.3%, 7.2%, and 14.3% in the 18-29, 30-39, and 40-49 year group, respectively; p<0.01). The overall prevalence of colorectal cancer was 1.6%, with no significant difference among the age groups (p=0.51). Colorectal neoplasia is not uncommon in Vietnamese individuals under 50 years, and the prevalence notably increases to 16.6% among those aged 40-49 years. These findings highlight the need for the prompt investigation and management of symptoms in this population. Nevertheless, further research in asymptomatic populations is needed to inform screening recommendations in Vietnam.",

    "title": "[Management of Colorectal Subepithelial Lesions: Differential Diagnosis and Follow-up].",
    "abstract": "The use of colonoscopy as a screening tool for colorectal cancer has increased, leading to the increasing detection of colorectal subepithelial lesions (SELs). These lesions are typically asymptomatic at diagnosis, appearing as small, protruding growths covered by normal mucosa. Colorectal SELs represent a diverse spectrum of lesions, and their differentiation based solely on their endoscopic appearance, endoscopic ultrasound, or radiology imaging remains challenging. Although many lesions are benign, certain types, including neuroendocrine tumors, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and lymphomas, have malignant potential and warrant thorough evaluation and management. Current research, treatment, and follow-up strategies for these lesions are limited, often relying on the guidelines developed for upper gastrointestinal SELs. Unlike upper gastrointestinal SELs, colonoscopy is essential for the follow-up of colorectal SELs. However, it is time-consuming and costly, and obtaining tissue biopsies through endoscopic ultrasound can be technically challenging. This review aims to provide clinicians with foundational insights into managing colorectal SELs, and facilitating optimal patient care through a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature.",

    "title": "Synergistic Induction of Immunogenic Cell Death by Biomineralized Manganese and Bisphosphonates Enhances Anti-PD-L1 Therapy in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.",
    "abstract": "Despite therapeutic benefits of anti-Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), low response rates and resistance limit its efficacy. Both manganese (Mn) and bisphosphonates (BPs) are known to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). Strategies to synergistically enhance ICD induction and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be fully explored. We analyzed the mode of apoptosis and immunogenicity of cancer cells post-treatment using Western blotting, flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy. RNA sequencing was employed to identify activated apoptotic pathways and elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ICD when Mn\u00b2<sup>+</sup> and BPs act synergistically. In 4T1 tumor models, we evaluated the synergistic anti-tumor effect of Mn\u00b2<sup>+</sup> and BPs with anti-PD-L1 antibodies. By leveraging the doping capacity of hydroxyapatite (HA) for Mn\u00b2<sup>+</sup> and its high affinity for BPs, we developed MnHARis particles-a biocompatible slow-release system of biomineralized Mn\u00b2<sup>+</sup> and risedronate (Ris). Compared to Mn2+ and Ris alone, MnHARis achieved a synergistic antitumor effect, manifesting as increased cytotoxicity (IC50 reduced by 17 times) and the emergence of more significant mitochondrial autophagic apoptosis (more pronounced nuclear fragmentation, increased ROS levels, significantly decreased ATP levels, depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, upregulation of autophagy markers (LC3B and Beclin), and obvious autophagosomes). MnHARis exerts its antitumor effects via the p38-MAPK pathway. Additionally, increased exposure of calreticulin and increased secretion of high mobility group box 1 indicated that MnHARis successfully induced ICD and promoted specific recognition and cross-presentation of damage-associated molecular patterns released by apoptotic tumor cells by activating dendritic cells and pattern recognition receptors, thereby altering TME of TNBC, increasing TILs, and sensitizing TNBC to anti-PD-L1 therapy. MnHARis effectively synergizes Mn\u00b2<sup>+</sup> and Ris to promote autophagic apoptosis and ICD, increasing TILs and sensitizing TNBC to anti-PD-L1 therapy, thus offering a new therapeutic strategy.",

    "title": "Navigating prognostic strategies for GH- and PRL-secreting pituitary neuroendocrine tumors: key insights from a clinicopathological study.",
    "abstract": "The classification of pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs), also known as pituitary adenomas, has progressed significantly since 2004. The PitNET lineage now serves as the foundation of the classification. We investigated the prognostic value of clinicopathological markers in a cohort of patients diagnosed with acromegaly and prolactinomas who underwent transsphenoidal tumor resection. A total of 50 patients (45 patients with confirmed acromegaly and 5 with prolactinomas) in evidence at 'C. I. Parhon National Institute of Endocrinology (Pituitary and Neuroendocrine Pathology Department, Bucharest, Romania), who underwent tumor resection between 2010 and 2023, was recruited, with a median follow-up time of 7.02 years (IQR: 3-10). Surgical samples were stained for anterior pituitary hormones, ki-67 labeling index, CAM 5.2 expression, and the following transcription factors (TFs): steroidogenic factor (SF-1), T-box family member TBX19 (TPIT) and POU class 1 homeobox 1 (PIT-1). Additionally, somatostatin receptor 5 (SSTR 5) and 2 (SSTR 2) expression was evaluated in all patients. Based on the 2022 WHO classification, the majority of cases were PIT-1 lineage tumors (n=40, 72.7%), followed by TPIT-lineage (n=4, 7.3%), and SF-1 lineage (n=3, 5.5%) and 14.5% (n=4) were classified as tumors with no distinct cell lineage (NDCL). In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, the postoperative GH value was independently associated with the outcome (HR 1.042, 95% CI 1.004-1.081, p=0.030), as well as the postoperative PRL value (HR 1.95% CI 1,1.001, p=0.019), the ki-67 labelling index (HR 2.43, 95% CI 1.109-5.330, p=0.026). Other factors associated as well with the success of the treatment were the postoperative tumor diameter (HR 1.038 95% CI 0.997-1.080, p=0.068) and the expression of SSTRs 2 and 5. Combining the four parameters, ki-67, SSTR 2, SSTR 5, GH, IGF-1 and the maximal tumor diameter (postoperative values), we established a prediction model with an AUC of 0.924 and relatively high sensitivity and specificity. A clear classification system that can guide clinical and neurosurgical management of patients with GH- and PRL-secreting PitNETs is not currently available, but certain clinicopathological factors can be used to predict patient prognosis. In our study, somatostatin receptor expression, ki-67, and postoperative values of GH and IGF-1, as well as the maximal postoperative tumor diameter, were the strongest predictors of outcome.",

    "abstract": "Mucosal melanoma, a rare subtype of melanoma affecting mucosal surfaces, presents significant challenges in diagnosis and treatment, particularly due to its low programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and reduced response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). This case report describes a 58-year-old woman with metastatic nasal mucosal melanoma initially resistant to neoadjuvant ipilimumab and nivolumab. After undergoing hepatic transcatheter arterial embolization, she experienced an unexpected abscopal effect, where distant metastases showed near-complete resolution despite prior lack of response to immunotherapy. The patient's disease initially progressed despite two cycles of ICI treatment, and further immunotherapy with nivolumab and relatimab did not improve her condition. Subsequently, after bland embolization of a dominant hepatic mass, the patient received re-challenged combination immunotherapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab, leading to significant regression in metastatic sites including the liver, lungs, lymph nodes, and bones. This response contrasts with prior reports and highlights a potential mechanism by which embolization therapies may alter the immune microenvironment and enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy. The abscopal effect observed following local hepatic embolization may be attributed to tumor-induced immune activation, which is further amplified by ICI treatment. This case underscores the potential for integrating local embolization with immunotherapy to overcome resistance in metastatic melanoma, particularly in mucosal subtypes. Further research is necessary to elucidate the immune mechanisms underlying these responses and to optimize treatment strategies for melanoma patients.",

    "title": "Acute myeloid leukemia-derived extracellular vesicles induced DNA methylation changes responsible for inflammatory program in normal hematopoietic stem progenitor cells.",
    "abstract": "Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) cells communicate with surrounding normal cells, including hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs), in the bone marrow, and modify their fate supporting tumor growth. This communication can be mediated by Extracellular Vesicles (EVs), small vectors carrying a range of tumor molecular information. One of the hallmarks of AML is the aberrant DNA methylation. It is not known if and how AML cells can modify the epigenomic profile of healthy HSPCs. Here, we investigated the DNA methylation profile of HSPCs after exposure to AML derived-EVs. Cord blood derived-HSPCs were treated with AML cell line derived-EVs for 20 hours and then their DNA methylation profile was analyzed by methylation array. We cross-referenced differential methylated genes (dmGs) with differential expressed genes (deGs) obtained by gene expression profile of same EV treated-HSPCs. Gene ontology was performed on dmGs and deGs. To confirm the expression of some genes, digital PCR was applied. AML-EVs induced DNA methylation changes in HSPCs after short time exposure, showing 110-890 dmGs. In particular, we reported a DNA hypo-methylation in both promoter and body regions. DmGs showed an enrichment in hematopoietic and immunological processes, inflammation, cell movement and AML pathways. The intersection between dmGs and deGs identified 20 common genes, including DSE, SEMA4A, NFKB1 and MTSS1, whose over-expression could be associated with the hypo-methylation of their gene body, and other ones, such as SLA and CUTA whose down-expression could be associated with the hypo-methylated promoter. These deGs were involved in NF-kB pathway, interleukin mediate Toll like receptor signaling and, of note, in tumor. This study is the first proof-of-concept that AML-EVs were able to induce changes in DNA methylation of HSPCs modulating the expression of genes involved in inflammatory processes capable of modifying normal hematopoiesis towards leukemic like processes.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of cancer has brought about a paradigm shift with the introduction of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy, which is mostly dependent on inhibiting PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4. However, recent studies have shown limited efficacy of this treatment in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Preliminary studies have found that tifcemalimab (the world's first anti-BTLA blocking monoclonal antibody) combined with toripalimab (PD-1) and chemotherapy has shown favorable safety and efficacy in several solid cancers. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant tifcemalimab combined with toripalimab and chemotherapy following esophagectomy for resectable ESCC, and the association of adjuvant immunotherapy with improved survival outcomes. Patients with pathologically confirmed cT1b-3N1-3M0 or cT2-3N0M0 thoracic ESCC were treated with neoadjuvant tifcemalimab (200mg, iv, d1) in combination with toripalimab (240mg, iv, d1) and chemotherapy (paclitaxel 135-175 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, d1 + cisplatin 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, d1) every 3 weeks for 2 cycles. Patients undergoing esophagectomy with pathological complete response (pCR) were administered up to 15 cycles of adjuvant tifcemalimab (200 mg) and toripalimab (240 mg), whereas patients without pCR received tifcemalimab in combination with toripalimab and adjuvant chemotherapy for 2 cycles, followed by tifcemalimab in combination with toripalimab immunotherapy up to 13 cycles. The patient with incomplete resection was decided to receive radiotherapy after a multidisciplinary consultation. The primary endpoint of this study was the pCR rate. The secondary endpoints include major pathological response rate (MPR), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), adverse events, R0 resection rate, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS). The Ethics Committee of Henan Provincial People's Hospital has approved the protocol (No 2024-132-03). This study is the world's first prospective clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the BTLA inhibitor in combination with PD-1 and chemotherapy as neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy for locally advanced thoracic ESCC. We predicted that perioperative combination immunotherapy as a potentially preferred and effective treatment strategy may lead to better survival outcomes.",

The expression of PLAG1 was analyzed by Human Protein Atlas (HPA). The differential expression and prognosis of PLAG1 were analyzed based on TCGA pan-cancer data. The relationship between PLAG1 expression and tumor heterogeneity, stemness and immune infiltration was investigated. The enrichment analysis and biological function of PLAG1 in bladder cancer were analyzed. The expression of PLAG1 was increased in a variety of tumors and significantly correlated with the prognosis of patients. Their expression levels were associated with key immune checkpoint genes (CD274, HAVCR2), immune infiltration and immune stimulation factors (CD48, CD27). In bladder cancer, functional enrichment analysis indicated that PLAG1 was involved in epidermal related processes and immune pathways. PLAG1 gene expression reduction can significantly inhibit the proliferation of bladder cancer cells. PLAG1 has the potential to be a prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target for patients with malignant tumors.",

    "abstract": "Tumor metabolic reprogramming is a highly complex process that enables tumor survival in the presence of limited nutrients, involving multiple signaling pathways, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), and transcription factors. Lately, glutamine has been found to enhance the growth, spread, and drug resistance of cancer cells, while also fostering an immunosuppressive microenvironment that aids tumor development. However, in some tumors, such as pancreatic cancer and melanoma, additional glutamine can inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells, and this mechanism is closely related to the regulation of the immune microenvironment. Therefore, further exploration of glutamine metabolism in tumors is essential for understanding the pathogenesis of cancer and for developing new metabolically targeted therapies. We systematically review the latest research on the reprogramming of glutamine metabolism and its role of tumor growth, spread, and immune system regulation. Additionally, we review the clinical research progress on targeted glutamine therapies and their application in combination with current anti-tumor treatments. Ultimately, we address the challenges and prospects involved in resistance to anti-cancer strategies aimed at glutamine metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SIC) presents a critical complication in cancer patients, contributing notably to heart failure and elevated mortality rates. While its clinical relevance is well-documented, the intricate molecular mechanisms that link sepsis, tumor-driven inflammation, and cardiac dysfunction remain inadequately explored. This study aims to elucidate the interaction between post-tumor inflammation, intratumor heterogeneity, and the dysfunction of VSMC in SIC, as well as to evaluate the therapeutic potential of exercise training and specific pharmacological interventions. Transcriptomic data from NCBI and GEO databases were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with SIC. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), gene ontology (GO), and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were utilized to elucidate the biological significance of these genes. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations were used to investigate drug-target interactions, and immune infiltration and gene mutation analyses were carried out by means of platforms like TIMER 2.0 and DepMap to comprehend the influence of DVL1 on immune responsiveness. Through the utilization of the datasets, we discovered the core gene DVL1 that exhibited remarkable up-regulated expression both in SIC and in diverse kinds of cancers, which were associated with poor prognosis and inflammatory responses. Molecular docking revealed that Digoxin could bind to DVL1 and reduce oxidative stress in SIC. The DVL1 gene module related to SIC was identified by means of WGCNA, and the immune infiltration analysis demonstrated the distinctive immune cell patterns associated with DVL1 expression and the impact of DVL1 on immunotherapeutic resistance. DVL1 is a core regulator of SIC and other cancers and, therefore, can serve as a therapeutic target. The present study suggests that targeted pharmacological therapies to enhance response to exercise regimens may be a novel therapeutic tool to reduce the inflammatory response during sepsis, particularly in cancer patients. The identified drugs, Digoxin, require further <i>in vivo</i> and clinical studies to confirm their effects on SIC and their potential efforts to improve outcomes in immunotherapy-resistant cancer patients.",

Delayed wound healing increases the risk of systemic recurrence up to three-fold after excisional surgery for primary breast cancer. Patients with breast malignant tumors exhibit immune system dysfunction while T cells play a major role in the inflammatory process of wound healing. The time required to achieve wound closure depends on the severity of the wound. The content of <i>Piper crocatum</i> ethanol extract contains alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, steroids, and polyphenols.

SLAYER employs parallel analytical approaches examining both direct mutation-dependency associations and pathway-mediated relationships across 1080 cancer cell lines. Our integrative method identified 682 putative interactions, which were refined to 148 high-confidence candidates through stringent filtering for effect size, druggability, and clinical prevalence. Systematic validation against protein interaction databases revealed an \u223c14-fold enrichment of known associations among SLAYER predictions compared with random gene pairs. Through pathway-level analysis, we identified inhibition of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) as potentially synthetically lethal with RB1 mutations in bladder cancer. Experimental studies demonstrated selective sensitivity to AhR inhibition in RB1-mutant versus wild-type bladder cancer cells, which probably operates through indirect pathway-mediated mechanisms rather than direct genetic interaction. In summary, by integrating mutation profiles, gene dependencies, and pathway relationships, our approach provides a resource for investigating genetic vulnerabilities across cancer types.",

In clinical practice, smooth muscle tumors should be differentiated from perianal abscess and diseases such as rectal mesenchymal tumors and smooth muscle sarcomas.",

    "title": "A male patient with atrial myxoma and multiple metastatic intracranial aneurysms: A case report and literature review.",
    "abstract": "Atrial myxoma is the most common primary benign tumor of the heart, with over 75% occurring in the left atrium. The migration of myxoma cells can lead to rare neurological complications such as intracranial aneurysms, embolic strokes, and arteriovenous malformations. The most common neurological manifestations in such patients include seizures, nonspecific headaches, and cerebrovascular events. Herein, we present a rare case of a middle-aged man in his early 50s with metastatic myxomatous multiple fusiform aneurysms, who initially presented with the clinical manifestation of intracerebral hemorrhage. The patient underwent atrial myxoma resection, whereas the intracranial multiple fusiform aneurysms were managed conservatively. Four years later, digital subtraction angiography revealed progressive enlargement of the aneurysm in the A3 segment of the left anterior cerebral artery. We present the pathological report of the atrial myxoma and imaging findings showing the changes in the aneurysms, along with a review and summary of the relevant literature. This report offers new insights into treatment options for cases of atrial myxoma complicated with intracranial multiple aneurysms. This is the first reported case of a male patient in China presenting with intracerebral hemorrhage as the initial manifestation of atrial myxoma combined with multiple fusiform aneurysms.",

    "title": "SETD2 loss of function is a recurrent event in advanced-phase chronic myeloid leukemia and contributes to genomic instability: SETD2 loss in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia.",
    "abstract": "The SETD2 tumour suppressor encodes a histone methyltransferase that specifically trimethylates histone H3 on lysine 36 (H3K36me3), a key histone mark implicated in the maintenance of genomic integrity among other functions. We found that SETD2 protein deficiency, mirrored by H3K36me3 deficiency, is a nearly universal event in advanced-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. Similarly, K562 and KCL22 cell lines exhibited markedly reduced or undetectable SETD2/H3K36me3 levels, respectively. This resulted from altered SETD2 protein turnover rather than mutations or transcriptional downregulation, and proteasome inhibition led to the accumulation of hyper-ubiquitinated SETD2 and to H3K36me3 rescue suggesting that a functional SETD2 protein is produced but abnormally degraded. We demonstrated that phosphorylation by Aurora-A kinase and ubiquitination by MDM2 plays a key role in the proteasome-mediated degradation of SETD2. Moreover, we found that SETD2 and H3K36me3 loss impinges on the activation and proficiency of homologous recombination and mismatch repair. Finally, we showed that proteasome and Aurora-A kinase inhibitors, acting via SETD2/H3K36me3 rescue, are effective in inducing apoptosis and reducing clonogenic growth in cell lines and primary cells from advanced-phase patients. Taken together, our results point to SETD2/H3K36me3 deficiency as a mechanism, already identified by our group in systemic mastocytosis, that is reversible, druggable, and BCR::ABL1-independent, able to cooperate with BCR::ABL1 in driving genetic instability in CML. KEY POINTS: Virtually all CML patients in blast crisis display SETD2 loss of function. SETD2 loss seems to be accomplished at the posttranslational level rather than being the result of genetic/genomic hits or transcriptional repression. Phosphorylation by Aurora kinase A and ubiquitination by MDM2 contribute to SETD2 proteasome-mediated degradation in blast crisis CML patients. Loss of SETD2 results in increased DNA damage.",

    "title": "Walking Speed and Risk of Cancer in Two Prospective Cohort Studies.",
    "abstract": "Walking speed is a reliable marker of sarcopenia and a strong predictor of mortality, but its relationship with cancer incidence remains largely unexplored. We aimed to investigate the association between walking speed and the risk of any cancer and five common cancers, including lung, breast, colorectum, prostate, and stomach, and to explore potential mediation by biomarkers of inflammation, and lipid and glucose metabolism. The primary analysis was conducted in 431\u2009598 participants from the UK Biobank (mean age 56.3 [SD 8.1] years at baseline), and the generalizability of findings was further tested in 1311 participants from the Hong Kong Osteoporosis Study (HKOS; mean age 57.8 [SD 11.9] years). Walking speed was self-reported in the UK Biobank and measured using a timed 6-m walk test in the HKOS. Incident cancer cases were identified from electronic health records. We used Cox models, adjusted for age, sex, height, body mass index, socioeconomic, lifestyle factors, family history of cancer, and grip strength, to estimate the association between walking speed and cancer incidence. Single and multiple mediator models were performed in the UK Biobank to examine the mediating effects of C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell (WBC) count, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and glucose levels. Over a median follow-up of 10.9 and 6.9\u2009years, 11.7% and 5.0% of the UK Biobank and HKOS participants were diagnosed with cancer, respectively. In the UK Biobank, those reported a brisk vs. slow walking pace had a 13% lower risk of any cancer (95% CI 0.84-0.90). Similarly, HKOS participants with a faster walking speed (\u2265\u20091.0 vs. <\u20091.0\u2009m/s) had a 45% reduced risk of any cancer (95% CI 0.31-0.98). In the UK Biobank, brisk walking pace was associated with a significantly decreased risk of lung cancer (hazard ratio [HR] 0.47, 95% CI 0.42-0.53) and a slightly increased risk of prostate cancer (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.21). CRP, WBC count, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol significantly mediated the association between brisk walking pace and any cancer, with proportions of mediation being 6.4% (95% CI 4.4-8.7%), 11.4% (8.4-17.1%), 9.3% (7.1-12.9%), and 8.3% (6.1-11.9%), respectively. The combined mediated proportion of all five potential mediators was 25.9% (19.5-37.2%). Faster walking speed, whether self-reported or measured, is associated with a reduced risk of cancer development. This association appears to be partially mediated by lower inflammation and improved lipid profiles.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe risk factors associated with hematoma formation following ultrasound (US)-guided vacuum-assisted excision (US-VAE) of breast fibroadenoma (FA), particularly those related to the US features of the lesions, remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the US features influencing hematoma formation after US-VAE of FAs.Materials and methodsThis retrospective analysis included 137 patients with 145 FA nodules who underwent US-VAE at our hospital from January 2018 to August 2024, and subsequently underwent US follow-up to monitor hematoma formation and absorption. The US features of the lesions, including size, number of nodules removed, location, depth, distance from the nipple, peripheral tissue structure, and color Doppler flow features, were retrospectively analyzed to identify the potential risk factors associated with hematoma formation.ResultsHematomas formed in 78 nodules (53.8%) 24-48 h after the US-VAE procedure and disappeared within 6 months in 77 cases (98.7%). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, FA depth\u2009\u2265\u20091.5 cm or <0.7 cm (OR = 2.490, 95% CI: 1.056-5.872; <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05), surrounding tissue mainly composed of fat (OR = 2.471, 95% CI: 1.043-5.857; <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.05), and rich blood supply (OR = 3.164, 95% CI: 1.444-6.934; <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.01) were independent risk factors for hematoma formation.ConclusionMost hematomas that formed after US-VAE for breast FA disappeared within 6 months. FA depth\u2009\u2265\u20091.5 cm or <0.7 cm, surrounding tissue mainly composed of fat, and rich blood supply indicated the possibility of hematoma formation after US-VAE.",

    "abstract": "To study the abnormal characteristics of tongue consonants and their correlation with articulatory movement parameters in patients with tongue cancer after operation. A total of 119 patients with tongue cancer who received surgical treatment at First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical University from March 2019 to May 2023 were selected. The patients were divided into tongue margin group(n=38), tongue body group (n=40) and tongue base group(n=41). Twenty-five monosyllabic words in Huang Zhaoming-Han Zhijuan Vocabulary List for evaluating tongue consonants were used as speech assessment tools to evaluate the errors of each tongue consonant. The articulation speech measurement and training instrument were used to extract the second formants (F2) of the /i/ and /u/ vowels of the patients by linear predictive spectrum, and the articulation movement parameters such as tongue distance and F2i/F2u were calculated according to the formula. SPSS 26.0 software package was used for data analysis. The rate of tongue consonant error in each group was as follows: in tongue margin group, preapical sound (49.5%)\uff1e apical middle sound (27.8%)\uff1e apical postapical sound (17.5%)\uff1elingual facial sound (9.4%)\uff1e lingual base sound (6.1%). In tongue body group, preapical sound (55.0%)\uff1e apical middle sound (47.1%) \uff1e apical postapical sound (25.4%)\uff1elingual facial sound (12.1%)\uff1elingual base sound (3.3%). In tongue base group, preapical sound (60.0%)\uff1epostapical sound (52.0%) \uff1eapical medium sound (51.9%)\uff1elingual base sound (44.3%)\uff1elingual facial sound (34.8%). The error frequency of tongue apex medium sound in tongue body group and tongue base group was significantly higher than that in tongue margin group, and the error frequency of tongue apex posterior sound, tongue surface sound and tongue base sound in tongue base group was significantly higher than that in tongue body group and tongue margin group(P\uff1c0.05). Tongue distance and F2i/F2u in tongue base group were significantly lower than those in tongue margin group and tongue body group, and tongue distance and F2i/F2u in tongue body group were significantly lower than those in tongue margin group(P\uff1c0.05). Tongue distance, F2i/F2u were significantly negatively correlated with the error frequency of apical midpoint, apical postpoint and base sound in all groups(r\uff1c0, P\uff1c0.05). Most patients with tongue cancer after operation have abnormal tongue tip, and the most serious problem is the pretip. In clinical practice, objective parameters such as tongue distance and F2i/F2u can be used to quantitatively and indirectly evaluate the articulation status and dynamic rehabilitation effect of tongue cancer patients after surgery.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the clinical effect of autologous fat grafting for treating cervical skin fibrosis in patients with oral cancer after neck dissection with or without radiotherapy. A total of 20 patients who underwent oral cancer resection and neck dissection in Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine from October 2022 to July 2023 were enrolled, 7 patients were treated with radiotherapy after neck dissection and 13 patients were treated with neck dissection. According to the degree of face-neck depression, the range of fibrosis and the function of neck and shoulder, corresponding volume of autologous fat was used to fill the depression. Three months after treatment, the improvement of cervical skin fibrosis was evaluated in terms of scar improvement, shoulder and neck function, and quality of life. SPSS 26.0 software package was used for statistical analysis of the data. The interval between the treatment of oral cancer and fat filling was 11-72 months, and the dose of fat grafting was 15-45 mL. There were no complications such as local induration, infection and necrosis in all patients. Three months after treatment, the results of Constant-Murley Score(CMS), neck fibrosis symptom(VAS), patient observer scar assessment scale(PSAS, OSAS) and FACE-Q quality of life score were better than those before treatment, and the differences were statistically significant(P\uff1c0.05). Autologous fat grafting can significantly improve the fibrosis of the neck skin after neck dissection with or without radiotherapy, and improve shoulder and neck dysfunction caused by surgery and radiotherapy. This method is worthy of clinical used because of the low rate of complication.",

    "abstract": "To construct a brachytherapentic model of patient-derived salivary gland malignant tumor organoids, and evaluate the impact of 125I radioactive seeds intervention on the activity of different organoids, and explore the feasibility of using this model to guide clinical personalized treatment of salivary gland malignant tumors. Biopsy specimens from patients with malignant salivary gland tumors including mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC), adenoid cystic carcinoma(ACC) and acinic cell carcinoma (AciCC) from Xuzhou Central Hospital were collected, and 3D culture method was used to construct the organoid model. The expression levels of immunohistochemical indicators in salivary gland malignant tumor tissue samples and organoid samples were detected. Brachytherapentic model was constructed and the effect of different doses of 125I seeds on organoid activity were detected using 3D cell viability assay. The activity curves were plotted and the IC50 values were calculated. The data were analyzed by GraphPad Prism 9.0 software. H-E staining results and immunohistochemical staining results identified homology between organoids and specimen tumors. The mean IC50 values of 125I seeds on 5 cases of salivary gland malignant tumor organoids (1 case of ACC, 2 cases of AciCC and 2 cases of MEC) were 8 508, 6 053, 5 203, 10 379 and 7 743 cGy, respectively. AciCC has a higher sensitivity to 125I seeds, and the sensitivity of 125I seeds varied among individuals of the same type of tumor. An in vitro tumor organoid culture platform has been established for specimens from patients with salivary gland malignant tumors, and its morphological, histological structure, and molecular marker expression are consistent with the characteristics of tumor cells in the original specimens. Intervention results indicated that the model has significant individualized differences, providing a theoretical basis and methodological reference for the effectiveness of 125I seeds in some patients with local, recurrent, advanced, poorly differentiated, or unresectable tumours. This model has the advantages of low cost, short modeling time, and high throughput detection. It can predict the patient's post-treatment response in vitro, guide risk assessment of malignant tumors in clinical practice, and establish personalized and precise treatment plans.",

    "title": "PEA3 Transcription Factors, Role in Invasion, Proliferation and Radioresistance of Glioblastoma Stem Cells.",
    "abstract": "The presence of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), known for their high invasiveness and resistance to radiation, is one of the reasons for systematic recurrence. It is therefore important to understand the resistance mechanisms of these cells to optimise therapies. We focused on the PEA3 family of transcription factors, ETV1, ETV4 and ETV5, in patient-derived GSCs. We demonstrate that ETV1 is over-expressed in high invasive GSCs. In 3D invasion assays, inhibiting ETV1 expression using specific siRNAs significantly reduces cell invasion. Furthermore, we show a significant correlation between ETV1 and ZEB1, a major driver of invasion. Blocking ETV1 decreases ZEB1 expression in GSCs. The study also demonstrates the essential role of ETV1, ETV4 and ETV5 in the radioresistance of GSCs and their ability to form neurospheres. Using specific siRNAs to inhibit the expression of these transcription factors led to an increased sensitivity of GSCs to radiation and a decrease in both the number and size of neurospheres. These findings suggest that PEA3 transcription factors play a major role in GSCs aggressiveness by regulating invasion, radioresistance and the ability to form neurospheres.

    "title": "Optimal Primary Prophylaxis for Febrile Neutropenia During Neoadjuvant Cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil Plus Docetaxel for Esophageal Cancer: A Retrospective Cohort Study.",
    "abstract": "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) with docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (DCF) is the standard treatment for locally advanced esophageal cancer (LAEC). DCF is associated with a high risk of febrile neutropenia (FN), but the optimal primary prophylaxis remains unclear. The present study aimed to assess risk factors for FN and efficacy of primary prophylaxis using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and antibiotics in LAEC patients treated with DCF. Patients with LAEC who received DCF as NAC between January 2016 and June 2022 at Aichi Cancer Center Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. DCF consisted of docetaxel 70\u2009mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1, cisplatin 70\u2009mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1, and 5-FU 750\u2009mg/m<sup>2</sup> by continuous infusion over 5\u2009days. The patients were divided into Cohort A [no G-CSF], B1 (G-CSF after day 6), and B2 (G-CSFon day 3-4). The efficacy of primary prophylaxis with G-CSF and antibiotics during the first cycle was evaluated. The potential FN risk factors were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses. Among the 156 patients with esophageal cancer who received DCF as NAC, 41 (26%) patients developed FN during the first cycle. Multivariate analysis revealed that prophylactic antibiotics (17% vs. 40%; adjusted OR, 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-0.73; p\u2009=\u20090.006) and G-CSF (6% vs. 35%; adjusted OR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.04-0.47; p\u2009=\u20090.002) were associated with lower FN incidence. The grade 3/4 neutropenia rates were 84%, 43%, and 13% in cohorts A, B1, and B2, respectively. FN incidence was 35%, 13%, and 0% in the respective cohorts. Treatment-related death occurred in 2% of patients, none of whom received G-CSF prophylaxis. Prophylactic G-CSF and antibiotics reduce the risk of FN in patients with LAEC treated with DCF. Early timing of G-CSF administration showed a potential trend toward reduced FN risk and may offer additional benefits; however, these findings must be validated.",

    "abstract": "This report presents two rare cases of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) complicated by pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS), highlighting the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges posed by their coexistence. RA is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by joint inflammation and destruction, while PVNS is a rare proliferative synovial disorder that often presents with monoarticular joint involvement. The overlap in clinical and radiological features between RA and PVNS complicates diagnosis, necessitating advanced imaging techniques and histopathological evaluation for accurate differentiation. In the first case, an 85-year-old woman with a long-standing history of RA developed PVNS in the left knee, confirmed by MRI findings of hemosiderin deposition and nodular synovial hypertrophy. In the second case, a 72-year-old woman with seronegative RA and a prior history of PVNS in the elbows presented with PVNS in the left knee, confirmed by both imaging and pathology. Both patients underwent successful treatment involving a combination of systemic therapies, including disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologics, as well as localized interventions, such as synovectomy and corticosteroid injections. These cases underscore the importance of integrating imaging and histopathology in managing RA patients with persistent joint symptoms, as well as the necessity for a tailored therapeutic approach to address both systemic inflammation and localized pathology. A comprehensive literature review is provided to contextualize these findings, with a focus on the role of MRI and emerging therapies, such as colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitors, in the management of PVNS.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Agenesis of the dorsal pancreas (ADP) is a rare congenital anomaly resulting from incomplete development of the dorsal pancreatic bud, affecting the body and tail of the pancreas. While often asymptomatic, it can present with clinical abnormalities such as abdominal pain, diabetes, or obstructive jaundice, and may be associated with chronic pancreatitis and tumors. We report the third documented case of a high-grade neuroendocrine tumor located at the head of the pancreas in a patient with complete ADP, along with a review of the literature. CASE REPORT An 86-year-old man presented with jaundice caused by a 3-cm pancreatic mass compressing the bile duct, confirmed through imaging to be associated with ADP. Surgical intervention was declined, and a combined laparoscopic and radiological approach was used to place a biliary stent, alleviating symptoms. Histopathological analysis confirmed a poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC). Despite initial symptomatic relief, the patient died due to complications 3 months later. CONCLUSIONS This report underscores the diagnostic challenges of ADP and its potential association with pancreatic neoplasms. Improved imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) facilitate diagnosis and differentiation from similar conditions. The association between ADP and pancreatic tumors should warn us to be watchful with every patient diagnosed with ADP and focus on the early detection of possible malignancies. Further research is needed to clarify the genetic and developmental mechanisms linking ADP to tumorigenesis and to explore targeted therapeutic approaches.",

Its aberrant expression in cancers suggests a pivotal role in tumour progression. GMIP expression was assessed using transcriptomic datasets from GDC and UCSC XENA, and protein distribution across tissues via HPA and GeneMANIA. The TISCH database identified primary GMIP-expressing cell types in the tumour microenvironment. Univariate Cox regression assessed GMIP's prognostic potential, while cBioPortal and GSCA explored genomic alterations. TIMER 2.0 was used to investigate immune cell infiltration and GMIP's role in immune regulation. GSEA and GSVA unveiled GMIP-related biological pathways, and molecular docking with CellMiner identified potential drug interactions. In\u00a0vitro assays confirmed GMIP's functional relevance in breast cancer. GMIP exhibits differential expression across multiple cancer types, demonstrating significant prognostic implications. Its expression is inversely correlated with CNV and methylation in several cancers. GMIP is closely linked to immunotherapy biomarkers and immune suppression, influencing therapeutic responses. Functional studies suggest that GMIP inhibition reduces cancer cell proliferation and migration. GMIP is identified as a promising oncological biomarker, particularly in breast cancer, with potential therapeutic implications. GMIP's therapeutic potential is especially pronounced in BRCA-mutated tumours, underscoring its relevance for novel anticancer interventions.",

Consecutive patients treated with definitive radiation therapy (RT) for non-metastatic ASCC from 2005 to 2021 at one institution were retrospectively identified. Patient demographic and clinical data, including HIV status and pre-treatment VL, were tabulated. Pre-treatment PET metrics were calculated with semi-automatic gradient-based segmentation algorithms. Cox-proportional-hazard and Kaplan-Meier modelling were used to investigate tumour PET metrics and outcomes: overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and locoregional control (LRC). A total of 175 patients were included: 110 HIV-negative and 65 patients living with HIV (PLWH). Nineteen PLWH had detectable pre-treatment VL. Median follow-up was 58 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 28-99), with 28 locoregional failures and 31 deaths. Five-year LRC, PFS, and OS was 84%, 73%, and 86%, respectively. There was no significant difference in LRC, PFS, or OS between HIV-negative patients and PLWH. 156 patients had available pre-treatment PET scans. Metabolic tumour volume and total lesion glycolysis were significantly associated with LRC and PFS on multivariate Cox analysis for the entire cohort (p \u2264 0.02), and HIV-negative patients on Cox sub-group analysis (p \u2264 0.01). No association between PET metrics and outcomes was seen for PLWH. Outcomes were comparable between HIV-negative patients and PLWH. Pre-treatment PET metrics were validated as significantly predicting outcomes for the entire cohort and HIV-negative patients, not PLWH. This may be from small numbers of PLWH patients, or non-specific uptake in patients with uncontrolled HIV reducing PET's prognostic efficacy.",

Recent studies have indicated that ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) is overexpressed across various cancer types; however, its specific role and implications in AML have yet to be thoroughly investigated. To elucidate the clinical relevance and functional mechanisms of ARF6 in AML, we conducted an integrated analysis utilizing RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) alongside clinical samples and AML cell lines. The diagnostic potential of ARF6 was assessed through receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, and logistic regression was employed to identify factors correlating with elevated ARF6 expression. Functional assays were performed to elucidate the effects of ARF6 modulation on apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and AML cell proliferation, while mechanistic investigations focused on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, particularly in the context of pharmacological PI3K inhibition. Our findings revealed a significant upregulation of ARF6 in AML compared to normal controls, with diagnostic efficacy indicated by an AUC of 0.793. Logistic regression analysis identified older age (>\u200960\u2009years) and a higher white blood cell count (>\u200920\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>9</sup>/L) as significant predictors of high ARF6 expression. Moreover, elevated ARF6 levels were independently associated with shorter overall survival (HR\u2009=\u20091.634, p\u2009=\u20090.045). Notably, ARF6 knockdown induced apoptosis and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, whereas its overexpression yielded contrary effects. In addition, ARF6 activated the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which was abrogated by pharmacological PI3K inhibition. Collectively, our findings establish ARF6 as a valuable diagnostic and prognostic marker in AML, driving disease progression through the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. These insights not only enhance our understanding of AML pathology but also underscore the potential of targeting ARF6 for therapeutic intervention in AML treatment paradigms. Future research should aim at evaluating the therapeutic implications of targeting ARF6 in combination with existing treatment modalities.",

    "abstract": "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is widely recognized as the established treatment for advanced gastric cancer. However, predicting its efficacy before surgery remains challenging. The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) as a predictor of treatment response to the S-1+Oxaliplatin regimen (SOX). Thirty patients who underwent gastrectomy following neoadjuvant SOX between January 2021 and July 2023 were included. Patients underwent FDG-PET pre- and postsurgery. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) from FDG-PET was examined in relation to histological tumor response and prognosis. SUVmax decreased significantly after chemotherapy in all patients (p\u2009<\u20090.001), especially in those with Grade 1a, 2, and 3 tumors (p\u2009<\u20090.05). SUV reduction increased stepwise with the histological response grade. Optimal cut-off values for the percentage decrease in SUVmax (\u0394SUVmax) predictive of histologic efficacy were identified as 53% (area under curve 0.855, p\u2009=\u20090.0018) for Grade 1b or higher and 75% (area under curve 0.806, p\u2009=\u20090.0044) for Grade 2 or higher. Patients with \u0394SUVmax\u2009>\u200950% had improved recurrence-free survival (p\u2009=\u20090.027). FDG-PET may be useful as a predictor of treatment response in neoadjuvant SOX therapy for gastric cancer. The determination of the optimal \u0394SUVmax value may enhance the precision of histological tumor response prediction.",

    "title": "The Cost-Effectiveness of a Multi-Target Stool DNA-Based Screening (COLOTECT), FIT, Colonoscopy and No Screening for Colorectal Cancer.",
    "abstract": "Around 1.9 million new cases and 1 million deaths worldwide were attributed to colorectal cancer (CRC) in 2020. The aims of this study are to assess the cost-effectiveness of a multi-target stool DNA-based screening strategy, COLOTECT, compared to faecal immunochemical tests (FIT), colonoscopy, and no screening in the Asian population to inform more choices for policymakers in colorectal cancer screening. We assume that 100,000 persons aged 50 undergo annual FIT, annual COLOTECT multi-target testing, or colonoscopies every 10\u2009years until age 75. The data used in this study was retrieved from different sources including the Hong Kong Cancer Registry and previously published studies on the population aged 50 to 75\u2009years old between 2010 and 2023. This study accessed the most cost-effective screening strategy available. If a positive result of FIT or COLOTECT were observed, the participants would undergo a colonoscopy. The participants who used the colonoscopy as the main screening method conducted colonoscopies every 3\u2009years. The Markov models were utilized to compare the outcomes from different strategies including life-years saved, years of life lost, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (primary outcome). The highest ICER was observed in colonoscopy (USD 160808), followed by FIT (USD 108952), and COLOTECT (USD 82206). A higher detection rate of CRC (COLOTECT: 39.3% vs. FIT: 4.5%), more CRC cases prevented (1272 vs. 146), and life-years saved (2295 vs. 337) were observed in the COLOTECT strategy than in FIT. Additionally, a lower total cost per life-year saved of COLOTECT (USD 180097) was observed than colonoscopy (USD 238356), which identified the more affordable and cost-saving COLOTECT strategy. This study highlighted the better performance of COLOTECT than FIT in detecting CRC. Additionally, given its lower cost and higher acceptance, the COLOTECT strategy might be more cost-effective than colonoscopy for massive CRC screening.",

    "title": "Mapping the rapid growth of multi-omics in tumor immunotherapy: Bibliometric evidence of technology convergence and paradigm shifts.",
    "abstract": "This study aims to fill the knowledge gap in systematically mapping the evolution of omics-driven tumor immunotherapy research through a bibliometric lens. While omics technologies (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics)provide multidimensional molecular profiling, their synergistic potential with immunotherapy remains underexplored in large-scale trend analyses. A comprehensive search was conducted using the Web of Science Core Collection for literature related to omics in tumor immunotherapy, up to August 2024. Bibliometric analyses, conducted using R version 4.3.3, VOSviewer 1.6.20, and Citespace 6.2, examined publication trends, country and institutional contributions, journal distributions, keyword co-occurrence, and citation bursts. This analysis of 9,494 publications demonstrates rapid growth in omics-driven tumor immunotherapy research since 2019, with China leading in output (63% of articles) yet exhibiting limited multinational collaboration (7.9% vs. the UK's 61.8%). Keyword co-occurrence and citation burst analyses reveal evolving frontiers: early emphasis on \"PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade\" has transitioned toward \"machine learning,\" \"multi-omics,\" and \"lncRNA,\" reflecting a shift to predictive modeling and biomarker discovery. Multi-omics integration has facilitated the development of immune infiltration-based prognostic models, such as TIME subtypes, which have been validated across multiple tumor types, which inform clinical trial design (e.g. NCT06833723). Additionally, proteomic analysis of melanoma patients suggests that metabolic biomarkers, particularly oxidative phosphorylation and lipid metabolism, may stratify responders to PD-1 blockade therapy. Moreover, spatial omics has confirmed ENPP1 as a potential novel therapeutic target in Ewing sarcoma. Citation trends underscore clinical translation, particularly mutation-guided therapies. Omics technologies are transforming tumor immunotherapy by enhancing biomarker discovery and improving therapeutic predictions. Future advancements will necessitate longitudinal omics monitoring, AI-driven multi-omics integration, and international collaboration to accelerate clinical translation. This study presents a systematic framework for exploring emerging research frontiers and offers insights for optimizing precision-driven immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer remains one of the most challenging diseases to treat due to its heterogeneity. Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (KRAS) mutations are genetic drivers in numerous cancer types including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Despite recent advances in KRAS-targeted therapies, treatment resistance and limited therapeutic options necessitate advanced preclinical models, such as organoids, to identify personalized cancer therapies by screening novel therapeutic strategies and synergistic drug combinations. We established LUAD in genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models of Kras<sup>G12V</sup> & Trp53 <sup>\u0394ex2-10</sup> (KP) and KP with Ctnnb1<sup>\u0394ex3</sup> mutation (KPC). Tumor-derived organoids from these models recapitulated the genomic landscape and histopathological characteristics of their parental tumors. The organoids displayed tumorigenic potential when implanted in immunocompromised mice, forming tumors in contrast to unlike healthy lung-derived organoids. Drug screening identified effective kinase inhibitors and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors against the organoids. Notably, the combination of these drugs exhibited the highest synergy in KPC organoids. We successfully developed LUAD organoids harboring Kras mutations and identified multiple potential therapeutic agents targeting these cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated the effectiveness of a DNMT inhibitor-based combination therapy, presenting a promising strategy for this challenging lung cancer subtype.",

    "abstract": "Osteosarcoma is not often at the forefront of differential diagnoses for epiphyseal bone tumors because of its rarity; however, more than half of individuals affected by these uncommon cases experience a delay in diagnosis. In such clinical situations, the decision to promptly perform a biopsy of an epiphyseal bone tumor-while considering a potential diagnosis of osteosarcoma -remains unclear, particularly in adolescents. We present herein a case of epiphyseal osteosarcoma in an adolescent, the diagnosis of which was made with minimal delay. A 17-year-old male athlete presented to a previous hospital with knee pain. Radiographs obtained at the initial visit revealed a sclerotic mass in the femoral epiphysis. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 32-mm lesion adjacent to the remaining epiphyseal scar. When the patient was referred to our hospital 3 weeks later, X-rays showed a circular radiolucent shadow lesion, as well as an enlargement involving the scar on CT. MRI showed altered signal intensities in the cartilage region, with an increase in synovial fluid. These longitudinal changes indicated the need for an incisional biopsy with minimal delay, considering the possibility of malignancy, which resulted in a diagnosis of epiphyseal osteosarcoma. The patient received perioperative chemotherapy followed by a wide resection. The pathological examination of the resected sample validated the initial diagnosis. As of 1 year post-surgery, disease relapse had not been detected. This case highlights the benefit of longitudinal imaging investigations, which assisted in making a crucial diagnosis with minimal delay and enabled timely initiation of treatment before further disease progression.",

    "abstract": "Life-threatening conditions such as cancer can evoke demoralization, which is characterized by feelings of meaninglessness, hopelessness, and helplessness. Assessing demoralization in cancer patients is crucial. This study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Turkish version of the Demoralization Scale-II (TDS-II) and explore its relationship with sociodemographic and disease-related factors. This study included 287 cancer patients, 265 of whom completed the final analysis. The participants completed the TDS-II, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire-7 (GAD-7). The psychometric evaluation of the TDS-II involved assessments of convergent, construct, and discriminant validity and internal consistency. Structural validity analysis indicated that both single-factor and two-factor models demonstrated comparable model fit, with CFI and NFI values ranging from 0.903 to 0.944 and SRMR values below 0.05. However, internal discriminant validity was not supported, as the average variance extracted (AVE) values for each factor in the two-factor model were lower than the square of their correlation coefficient. Strong correlations between the TDS-II and the, PHQ-9 and GAD-7 supported convergent validity. The internal consistency was high, with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.93 for the TDS-II. Demoralization scores were significantly higher among women, patients with a family history of cancer, and those with stage IV disease. The Turkish version of the Demoralization Scale-II (TDS-II) is reliable for assessing demoralization in cancer patients and has strong psychometric properties. Screening for demoralization in high-risk groups may help prevent the progression of long-term psychological disorders.",

    "abstract": "The Albumin-Bilirubin Score (ALBI) serves as an indicator of nutritional status and is a widely recognized prognostic biomarker in cancer patients. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the association between ALBI and survival outcomes in patients with distal cholangiocarcinoma (dCCA) after radical surgery, and develop a nomogram model based on the ALBI to predict individual survival. A total of 177 individuals with dCCA receiving surgery from Jan 2011 to Jan 2022 were enrolled in the research. The association between ALBI and clinicopathologic factors was investigated. The impact of ALBI on recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models. Nomograms based on ALBI and other prognostic variables screened by multivariate analysis were produced in predicting RFS and OS of dCCA patients following radical surgery, and the nomograms were evaluated by the consistency index (C-index), calibration curve and decision curve analysis (DCA) curve. The optimal cut-off value for ALBI was -1.67, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.71. The High-ALBI group had a considerably shorter RFS and OS (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that the ALBI, degree of differentiation, portal vein invasion, and lymph node invasion were significant prognostic factors for RFS, and that the ALBI, CA19-9, degree of differentiation, lymph node invasion, and portal vein invasion were significant prognostic factors for OS. The nomograms were constructed based on these significant prognostic factors. The calibration curves displayed good consistency between actual and predicted probability. Nomograms based on these variables have better discriminant ability in predicting RFS and OS compared with the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM stage. Moreover, the scores predicted by the nomogram enabled patient stratification into low-points and high-points groups. Kaplan-Meier curves\u00a0demonstrated that patients in the high-points group had considerably better prognoses than those in the low-points group (p\u2009<\u20090.001). ALBI was an independent prognostic factor in predicting RFS and OS of dCCA patients after radical surgery. The nomograms based on ALBI can provide reliable, personalized survival prediction for dCCA.",

    "title": "Multi-omics analysis reveals CMTR1 upregulation in cancer and roles in ribosomal protein gene expression and tumor growth.",
    "abstract": "CMTR1 (cap methyltransferase 1), a key nuclear mRNA cap methyltransferase, catalyzes 2'-O-methylation of the first transcribed nucleotide, a critical step in mRNA cap formation. Previous studies have implicated CMTR1 in embryonic stem cell differentiation and immune responses during viral infection; however, its role in cancer biology remains largely unexplored. This study aims to elucidate CMTR1's function in cancer progression and evaluate its potential as a novel therapeutic target in certain cancer types. We conducted a comprehensive multi-omics analysis of CMTR1 across various human cancers using TCGA and CPTAC datasets. Functional studies were performed using CRISPR-mediated knockout and siRNA knockdown in human and mouse basal-like breast cancer models. Transcriptomic and pathway enrichment analyses were carried out in CMTR1 knockout/knockdown models to identify CMTR1-regulated genes. In silico screening and biochemical assays were employed to identify novel CMTR1 inhibitors. Multi-omics analysis revealed that CMTR1 is significantly upregulated at the mRNA, protein, and phosphoprotein levels across multiple cancer types in the TCGA and CPTAC datasets. Functional studies demonstrated that CMTR1 depletion significantly inhibits tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptomic analysis of CMTR1 knockout cells revealed that CMTR1 primarily regulates ribosomal protein genes and other transcripts containing 5' Terminal Oligopyrimidine (TOP) motifs. Additionally, CMTR1 affects the expression of snoRNA host genes and snoRNAs, suggesting a broader role in RNA metabolism. Mechanistic studies indicated that CMTR1's target specificity is partly determined by mRNA structure, particularly the presence of 5'TOP motifs. Finally, through in silico screening and biochemical assays, we identified several novel CMTR1 inhibitors, including N97911, which demonstrated in vitro growth inhibition activity in breast cancer cells. Our findings establish CMTR1 as an important player in cancer biology, regulating critical aspects of RNA metabolism and ribosome biogenesis. The study highlights CMTR1's potential as a therapeutic target in certain cancer types and provides a foundation for developing novel cancer treatments targeting mRNA cap methylation.",

    "abstract": "High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has significantly improved overall survival (OS) in primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). However, early identification of long-term survivors remains a challenge. Progression-free survival at 24 months (PFS24) has emerged as a key prognostic marker in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, but its relevance in PCNSL is still unclear. In this retrospective multicenter study, we analyzed data from 146 newly diagnosed, transplant-eligible PCNSL patients treated with MATRix-like regimens across 14 hospitals. With a median follow-up of 48 months, the 2-year PFS and OS rates were 50.4% and 65.6%, respectively. Of the 139 patients evaluable for PFS24-analysis, 51.1% reached PFS24, with a subsequent 5-year OS of 96.7%. Of note, the annual hazard rate for progression and death decreased to under 5% after 24 months, remaining stable thereafter. The patients who failed to reach PFS24 had a median OS of only 6.0 months. Key predictors of PFS failure included impaired Karnofsky performance status and treatment dose-reduction. In conclusion, PFS24 was identified as an important prognostic marker in PCNSL. Patients who achieve PFS24 have a favorable prognosis, whereas those who do not face poor outcomes and require innovative treatment approaches. This insight could aid in risk stratification and support the use of PFS24 as a surrogate endpoint in clinical trials.",

    "title": "A first-in-class inhibitor of homologous recombination DNA repair counteracts tumour growth, metastasis and therapeutic resistance in pancreatic cancer.",
    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the cancer types with poorest prognosis and survival rates primarily due to resistance to standard-of-care therapies, including gemcitabine (GEM) and olaparib. Particularly, wild-type (wt)BRCA tumours, the most prevalent in PDAC, are more resistant to DNA-targeting agents like olaparib, restraining their clinical application. Recently, we disclosed a monoterpene indole alkaloid derivative (BBIT20) as a new inhibitor of homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair with anticancer activity in breast and ovarian cancer. Since inhibition of DNA repair enhances the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy, we aimed to investigate the anticancer potential of BBIT20 against PDAC, particularly carrying wtBRCA. In vitro and in vivo PDAC models, particularly human cell lines (including GEM-resistant PDAC cells), patient-derived organoids and xenograft mice of PDAC were used to evaluate the anticancer potential of BBIT20, alone and in combination with GEM or olaparib. Disruption of the BRCA1-BARD1 interaction by BBIT20 was assessed by co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence and yeast two-hybrid assay. The potent antiproliferative activity of BBIT20, superior to olaparib, was demonstrated in PDAC cells regardless of BRCA status, by inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA damage, while downregulating HR. The disruption of DNA double-strand breaks repair by BBIT20 was further reinforced by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) suppression. The inhibition of BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer by BBIT20 was demonstrated in PDAC cells and confirmed in a yeast two-hybrid assay. In GEM-resistant PDAC cells, BBIT20 showed potent antiproliferative, anti-migratory and anti-invasive activity, overcoming GEM resistance by inhibiting the multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein, upregulating the intracellular GEM-transporter ENT1, and downregulating GEM resistance-related microRNA-20a and GEM metabolism enzymes as RRM1/2. Furthermore, BBIT20 did not induce resistance in PDAC cells. It inhibited the growth of patient-derived PDAC organoids, by inducing apoptosis, repressing HR, and potentiating olaparib and GEM cytotoxicity. The enhancement of olaparib antitumor activity by BBIT20 was confirmed in xenograft mice of PDAC. Notably, it hindered tumour growth and liver metastasis formation, improving survival of orthotopic xenograft mice of PDAC. Furthermore, its potential as a stroma-targeting agent, reducing fibrotic extracellular matrix and overcoming desmoplasia, associated with an enhancement of immune cell response by depleting PD-L1 expression in tumour tissues, renders BBIT20 even more appealing for combination therapy, particularly with immunotherapy. These findings underscore the great potential of BBIT20 as a novel multifaceted anticancer drug candidate for PDAC treatment.",

    "title": "Improving cervical cancer screening participation by introducing HPV vaginal self-sampling to women living with HIV in Denmark- a pilot study.",
    "abstract": "Cervical cancer, despite being largely preventable through vaccination and screening, continues to pose a significant global health challenge. Women living with HIV (WLWH) are at a six-fold higher risk of developing cervical cancer, primarily due to persistent infection with high-risk HPV (hrHPV). While effective screening methods have the potential to reduce this risk, WLWH remain inadequately screened. The aims of this pilot study were fourfold: To estimate the proportion of WLWH who are not screened according to WHO guidelines; to establish the proportion of WLWH who accepted the self-sampling offer; to estimate the hrHPV DNA prevalence; and to estimate the compliance to follow-up among women with a hrHPV-positive vaginal self-sample. This single-centre, pilot study was conducted from February to May 2022 at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Aarhus University Hospital, Central Denmark Region. Eligible women were contacted by phone and invited to participate. Participants were provided with a self-sampling kit (Evalyn<sup>\u00ae</sup> Brush) and detailed instructions. The collected samples were analysed for hrHPV DNA using the COBAS<sup>\u00ae</sup> 4800 assay. Demographic, clinical, and screening history data were obtained from medical records and the Danish Pathology Databank. Of the 100 eligible participants, 50% (n\u2009=\u200950) accepted the offer of self-sampling, and 80% (n\u2009=\u200940/50) returned their samples for analysis. The prevalence of hrHPV among these women was 25% (n\u2009=\u200910/40). Follow-up compliance among hrHPV-positive women was 40% (n\u2009=\u20094/10). The analysis revealed that 41% (n\u2009=\u200941/100) of WLWH had not been screened in accordance with WHO guidelines, and 39% (n\u2009=\u200916/41) of the women had never undergone screening. No significant differences were observed in demographic or clinical characteristics between participants and non-participants. Vaginal hrHPV self-sampling was acceptable and feasible for WLWH, with high return rates but suboptimal follow-up compliance. Enhancing participation and adherence is crucial for effective cervical cancer prevention. Larger studies are needed to validate these findings and optimize screening strategies. The Central Denmark Region Committee on Health Research Ethics deemed this study as a quality improvement study on the 9th of November 2021 (request approval j.no: 204/1-10-72-274-21).

    "abstract": "Clinical data have shown that Serine/Threonine Kinase 11 (STK11) mutation may be associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (ITEM) and poor prognosis and failure of anti-PD-1 (\u03b1PD1) treatment in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To explore the potential of restoring STK11 protein in immunotherapy, a bionic gene delivery system was prepared by coating the STK11-encoded DNA-cationic polymer complex core with the tumor cell membrane, termed STK11@PPCM. STK11@PPCM could specifically bind with NSCLC cells and achieve precise delivery of STK11-encoded DNA. The released DNA effectively restored the STK11 protein expression, consequently reactivating autophagy and immunogenic cell death (ICD) in cancer cells. The liberated damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and autophagosome induced dendritic cells (DCs) maturation, which in turn enhanced CD8\u2009+\u2009T cell infiltration, M1 macrophage polarization, and proinflammatory factor expression, thereby reversing the ITEM. Moreover, STK11@PPCM was also found to improve the sensitivity of cancer cells to \u03b1PD1 by increasing the expression of PD-L1, which was confirmed in STK11-mutated NSCLC cell xenografted mouse models, constructed by CRISPR-Cas9 knockout technology. This work demonstrated for the first time that restoration of functional STK11 can effectively reverse ITME and boost \u03b1PD1 efficacy in NSCLC, offering a new therapeutic approach for STK11-mutated lung adenocarcinoma in clinic.",

Five years later, a fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan detected a hypermetabolic lesion near the right piriformis muscle and internal iliac vessels, leading to surgical excision and radiotherapy, which confirmed metastasis. Three years after that, the patient presented with right-sided sciatica. Magnetic resonance neurography revealed characteristic features of perineural spread, including thickening, hyperintensity, enhancement, and diffusion restriction of the right sciatic and pudendal nerves, as well as the sacral roots (S1-S4). These findings differed from other neuropathic conditions, such as tumoral compression, traumatic neuropathy, and post-radiotherapy changes. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography and biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma. Despite additional chemotherapy, the disease progressed, resulting in cerebral, lung, and bone metastases. The patient passed away 1 year later. This case highlights the potential role of the magnetic resonance neurography in the accurate diagnosis of perineural spread in rectal cancer, emphasizing the value of functional magnetic resonance neurography sequences in differentiating it from other causes of neuropathic pain. This is essential for clinicians, as perineural spread is associated with a poor prognosis and necessitates appropriate management.",

    "abstract": "Gastric SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated tumors are rare and have a poor prognosis. We analyzed two cases of gastric SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated tumors with clinicopathologic characteristics, treatment and flow-up. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the expression of BRG1 (SAMRCA4), SMARCB1 (INI-1), CKpan, Ki-67, CD3, CD20, CD163, PD-1, and PD-L1 in gastric SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated tumors. Additionally, the clinical characteristics, imaging features, diagnosis, and treatment were analyzed. Two elderly male patients (69 and 61 years old) with a large ulcerated mass located in the gastric fundus and cardia. Histologically, the tumor is of low adhesion, diffusely infiltrating lamellar growth, without any percentage of epithelial differentiation zones, and with little stromal component. Tumor cells round, oval, a small amount of irregular shape, easy to see mitotic figures. Some of them had obvious nucleoli, and a few had multiple nucleoli. The cytoplasm varies, and some cells are more abundant. Significant vascular and neural invasion. BRG1(SMARCA4) was absent, INI-1 was present, and Ki-67 proliferation index was highly expressed (\u2265\u200980%). The remaining sarcoma-specific markers were negative. In case 1, the epithelial markers were negative and the PD-L1 combined positive score was 5. In case 2, CKpan was weakly expressed in only a dozen cells, and the PDL1 CPS was 10. The two patients received chemotherapy and anti-PD1 immunotherapy after radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer. The postoperative follow-up time of the two patients was 16 (case 1) and 3 months (case 2), respectively. The general condition was good, no recurrence or metastasis was observed, and the plasma tumor markers were in the normal range. Large SMARCA4-deficient tumors are more likely to have massive necrosis on the surface, leading to negative biopsy results. This tumor has a diffuse lamellar growth and needs to be differentiated from a variety of tumors with similar morphology, such as lymphoma, malignant melanoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma and undifferentiated sarcoma. The tumor cells were negative or only slightly positive for CKpan increases the difficulty of pathological diagnosis of this disease. However, loss of BRG1 (SMARCA4) expression can confirm the diagnosis. Chemotherapy combined with anti-PD1 treatment may have potential benefits in the management of gastric SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated tumors. However, given the rarity of these tumors and the limited number of cases in our study, further research with larger cohorts is needed to validate these preliminary results.",

    "title": "Evaluation of the antiproliferative, cytotoxic and phytochemical properties of Zimbabwean medicinal plants used in cancer treatment.",
    "abstract": "Cancer cases have been on the rise globally and several treatment strategies have been developed but mortality rates remain high. Zimbabwe, like many other countries, has also experienced a surge in cancer cases. In Zimbabwe, medicinal plants have been widely used to treat cancer for centuries. However, there has been limited research on the effectiveness, safety, and chemical composition of these plants. The current study assessed antiproliferative, cytotoxic and phytochemical properties of selected Zimbabwean medicinal plants. Cytotoxic activity of Agelenthus pungu, Carissa edulis, Dombeya rotundifolia, Flacourtia indica, Lannea discolor, Leonotis ocymifolia, Leucas martinicensis, Plicosepalus kalachariensis, Pseudolachnostylis maproneifolia, Solanum incanum, Strychnos cocculoides, Strychnos spinosa and Viscum verrucosum extracts were evaluated on normal murine peritoneal cells and sheep erythrocytes while antiproliferative activity was assessed on Jurkat T and HL60 cell lines. Cell viability was determined using the trypan blue exclusion and sulforhodamine B assay. Additionally, the effect of reduced glutathione on cytotoxic extracts was examined. The phytochemicals of the methanolic extracts were qualitatively determined using standard methods. Agelenthus pungu, Carissa edulis, Flacourtia indica, Strychnos cocculoides, Strychnos spinosa and Viscum verrucosum were cytotoxic to normal murine peritoneal cells. Flacourtia indica and Viscum verruscosum caused haemolysis of sheep erythrocytes at a concentration of 250\u00a0\u00b5g/mL for both plant extracts and 125\u00a0\u00b5g/mL for Viscum verrucosum. Cell viability increased on addition of 25\u00a0\u00b5g/mL of reduced glutathione to the extracts considered the most cytotoxic extracts, Agelenthus pungu and Viscum verrucosum. Agelenthus pungu, Carissa edulis, Leonotis ocymifolia, Leucas martinicensis and Viscum verrucosum significantly inhibited Jurkat T and HL60 cell proliferation. Viscum verrucosum was the most potent with the lowest half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values of 33 and 34\u00a0\u00b5g/mL on Jurkat T and HL60 cell lines respectively. The most dominant phytochemical classes were alkaloids, flavonoids and saponins. This study demonstrates that Agelenthus pungu, Carissa edulis, Leonotis ocymifolia, Leucas martinicensis and Viscum verrucosum have antiproliferative activity against Jurkat T and HL60 cell lines. Viscum verrucosum was the most potent. These findings emphasise the importance of medicinal plants as well as their potential use as sources of novel compounds in anticancer drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a heterogeneous malignancy with poor prognosis. Dysregulation of E2F transcription factors (E2Fs), which control cell proliferation and apoptosis, is implicated in HNSCC pathogenesis. This study explores HNSCC molecular heterogeneity via E2Fs expression, identifies distinct subtypes, and develops a prognostic model that integrates gene expression, immune infiltration, and drug sensitivity. We analyzed the TCGA-HNSC dataset (n\u2009=\u2009494) and classified samples based on the expression of eight E2Fs using ConsensusClusterPlus. The optimal number of clusters (k\u2009=\u20092) was determined with the getOptK() function, which assesses cluster stability via internal consistency metrics. Differentially expressed genes between subtypes were identified with limma, and functional annotation was performed using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses. A prognostic model was constructed using LASSO regression on genes significant in univariate Cox analysis and validated in an independent GSE41613 dataset (n\u2009=\u200997). Immune cell infiltration was estimated using CIBERSORT, and drug sensitivity predicted via pRRophetic. Confounding factors such as HPV and smoking status were not included due to incomplete data. Two distinct E2F-based subtypes emerged. Cluster 1, characterized by lower E2Fs expression, exhibited poorer overall survival (log-rank, p\u2009=\u20090.035) and was enriched in genes related to epidermal development, keratinocyte differentiation, and IL-17 signaling. In contrast, Cluster 2 showed higher E2Fs expression, better survival, and enrichment in genes associated with DNA replication and repair. Notably, high-risk patients demonstrated increased infiltration of M0 and M2 macrophages (p\u2009<\u20090.05), suggesting an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment that adversely affects prognosis. Our seven-gene prognostic model (AREG, CXCL14, FAM83E, FDCSP, ARHGAP4, EPHX3, and SPINK6) exhibited robust performance with AUCs of 0.692, 0.673, and 0.679 for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival, a C-index of 0.66, and good calibration. High-risk patients also showed greater sensitivity to targeted agents such as pazopanib and imatinib. These findings reveal two distinct E2F-based molecular subtypes of HNSCC that differ in prognosis, functional pathways, immune infiltration, and drug sensitivity. The prognostic model offers valuable risk stratification and identifies potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, warranting further experimental and clinical validation.",

    "abstract": "Melanoma is a highly aggressive form of skin cancer. Despite significant advances in targeted therapies and immunotherapeutic approaches, some patients still have poor response rates, making a deeper understanding of melanoma pathogenesis essential. The expression of Claspin (CLSPN), prognosis and immune infiltration in skin cutaneous melanoma patients were analyzed by public databases. Immunohistochemistry was used to validate. Moreover, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, western blot, cell counting kit-8 assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, animal experiments, and RNA-seq were applied to explore its biological functions and potential molecular mechanisms of CLSPN in melanoma. Our results demonstrated that abnormal CLSPN expression was correlated with poor prognosis in melanoma. Meanwhile, CLSPN may promote melanoma growth and progression in vivo and in vitro through IFI44L/JAK/STAT1 signaling. Additionally, CLSPN was associated with negative immune microenvironment in melanoma and may be related to polarization of tumor associated macrophages towards M2-type. These findings suggest that CLSPN may be a promising new target for melanoma and accelerate personalized therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Long non-coding RNA PVT1 (lncRNA PVT1) serves as a carcinogenic regulatory factor in several cancers; however, the expression and function of its transcriptional isomer PVT1-214 in gastric cancer (GC) are poorly understood. PVT1-214 and miR-671-5p levels in GC cells and tissues were analyzed through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Western blotting (WB) was used to detect Homo sapiens solute carrier family 45 member 4 (SLC45A4) expression in GC cells. Thereafter, the relationship between PVT1-214 and miR-671-5p was evaluated through dual-luciferase reporter assays and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) analysis. Additionally, the biological activities of PVT1-214, miR-671-5p and SLC45A4 in GC cells were analyzed through Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), 5-ethyl-20-deoxyuridine (EdU), colony formation and Transwell assays. The effect of PVT1-214 on GC was studied in vivo via a nude mouse tumor xenograft model. PVT1-214 overexpression in GC cells and tissues was positively related to tumor size, malignancy grade, lymphatic metastasis and clinical stage. PVT1-214 knockdown suppressed cell growth, invasion and migration in vitro, whereas PVT1-214 overexpression promoted tumor proliferation in vivo. In addition, PVT1-214 positively regulates SLC45A4 expression through its competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) activity against miR-671-5p. SLC45A4 expression was positively related to PVT1-214 expression. PVT1-214 competes with endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by binding to miR-671-5p. When miR-671-5p is inhibited, SLC45A4 is released from the complementary binding complex, thereby increasing SLC45A4 protein levels in GC cells. The present work revealed the candidate ceRNA regulatory pathway by which PVT1-214 regulates SLC45A4 expression in GC cells, which is achieved through competitive binding to endogenous miR-671-5p. The results of this study can shed novel light on new molecular targets for treating GC.",

    "title": "Transcriptome-scale analysis of functional alternative back-splicing events in colorectal cancer.",
    "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of non-polyadenylated RNAs generated from back-splicing of genes. Multiple circRNAs can be generated at a single gene locus through alternative back-splicing events (ABS), sharing the same 5' or 3' back-splice site. To date, how prevalent ABS events are and how they are participated in carcinogenesis of human colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unexplored. To explore the functional roles of ABS events in CRC carcinogenesis, we analyzed ribosomal RNA-depleted transcriptome sequencing data of 176 CRC samples and characterized the landscape of ABS events in CRC. CRC cancer-related ABS events were identified by comparing paired CRC tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues. Then, univariate and multivariate Cox regression was used to find prognostic ABS events. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo assays were used to exploring the functional roles of circXPO1-1 and circXPO1-2 in CRC. We totally identified 19,611 high confidence circRNAs in CRC, among which 17,874 (91\u00b71%) of circRNAs were found recurrently. The number of ABS circRNAs accounted for 68.8% of all identified high confidence circRNAs, which suggested that ABS events are prevalent in CRC transcriptome. Particularly, 552 ABS circRNAs were found to be aberrantly expressed between paired CRC tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues, and their parent genes are closely associated with cancer-related hallmarks. In addition, 13 differential ABS circRNAs were identified to be associated with CRC patient survival and could act as independent prognostic indicators. Furthermore, we identified two ABS circRNAs of XPO1 gene (circXPO1-1 and circXPO1-2). The result showed that overexpression of circXPO1-2 inhibited CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and in vivo, whereas circXPO1-1 is not, indicating that the circularization isoforms of XPO1 gene have different functions in CRC. In conclusion, our work provides the landscape of ABS events in CRC transcriptome and the close association of ABS circRNAs with tumorigenesis offers a new set of targets with potential clinical benefit.",

    "title": "Barriers of organized cervical cancer screening in Albania and Montenegro.",
    "abstract": "Organized cervical screening is vital for preventing cervical cancer. However, many existing screening programs fail to achieve their full potential, as demonstrated by core performance indicators. There are barriers that hinder the implementation and reduce effectiveness of the programs. This article explores barriers of cervical cancer screening in two Southeastern European countries, Albania and Montenegro, aiming to inform targeted strategies to improve healthcare equity and outcomes for women. The barrier assessment followed the EU-TOPIA framework, designed to identify barriers to effective breast-, cervical-, or colon cancer screening. This approach relies on an iterative process performed by country representatives responsible for screening and researchers with expertise in screening program planning and evaluation. It includes three steps: comprehensive description of screening activities; identification of key barriers via a previously published tool; and comprehensive assessment of the identified key barriers. The barrier assessment revealed shared challenges in cervical cancer screening in Albania and Montenegro. Both countries face difficulties in their invitation systems, limited outreach activities, and low participation rates. Fully integrated data systems at national level are absent, hindering program monitoring and data sharing. Financial constraints and resource limitations negatively affect program sustainability and quality, reducing public awareness and accessibility. Additionally, neither country has comprehensive up-to-date long-term strategies to support prevention and early detection efforts. Our study underscores the importance of addressing organizational barriers in cervical cancer screening to improve program effectiveness and accessibility. Aligning screening practices with EU and WHO standards is crucial for Albania and Montenegro as prospective EU members. Lessons from international best practices, such as integrating IT systems, employing multi-channel outreach strategies, and adopting legally supported long-term policies, offer actionable pathways for improvement. Policymakers should prioritize sustainable funding, centralized systems, and innovative approaches to overcome structural challenges.",

    "title": "Barriers and contributions of rural community health workers in enabling cancer early detection and subsequent care in India: a qualitative study.",
    "abstract": "The cancer burden in India is escalating, with rural regions facing the greatest challenges in access to early detection and treatment. Community Health Workers (CHWs), such as Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs), Village Health Nurses (VHNs), and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs), play a critical role in bridging these healthcare gaps. This study explores the barriers and contributions of CHWs while facilitating early detection and subsequent care in selected rural areas of India. This qualitative study is part of the Access Cancer Care India (ACCI) implementation research project, conducted in three states: Rajasthan, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. We conducted six focus group discussions (FGDs) with 47 CHWs, representing various health cadres, to investigate their experiences and the barriers they face in delivering cervical, breast and oral cancer care. The discussions were analyzed using Charmaz's Grounded Theory approach, with axial coding and constant comparative analysis until data saturation was reached. CHWs identified multiple barriers to cancer early detection and subsequent care delivery, organized into six overarching themes: (1) Program focus and awareness, (2) Treatment and referral challenges, (3) Acceptability and accessibility, (4) Rigid social customs and beliefs, (5) Lack of support at higher centers, and (6) Financial constraints. A lack of formal training, poor infrastructure, negative communication, fear of diagnosis, and financial burdens were among the major barriers highlighted. CHWs from Tamil Nadu and Kerala, where sporadic screening initiatives exist, reported better preparedness compared to their counterparts in Rajasthan. Additionally, the CHWs outlined the vital role of positive word-of-mouth and community engagement in improving cancer screening participation. CHWs in rural India face significant personal, community, and health system barriers while facilitating cancer early detection services and subsequent follow up. Addressing these barriers through tailored training, enhanced health infrastructure, and community-based interventions can improve cancer care access and outcomes in rural settings. Future policies should focus on strengthening CHW-led approaches and addressing the systemic barriers in cancer care delivery.",

    "abstract": "Supermicrosurgical lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LVA)is becoming popular for the management of breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL), but mainly provided in well-developed countries. Little is known on possibility of LVA with limited resources. This study aimed to evaluate feasibility of LVA in Egypt, where latest devices are not available. Medical records of patients who underwent LVA for progressive BCRL were reviewed. All patients were refractory to conservative treatment for 6 months or longer. As devices for near-infrared fluorescent lymphography was not available, a conventional high-frequency (18-MHz) ultrasound was used to localize the lymph vessels and veins for LVA. LVA was done using conventional microsurgery sets and 10\u2009-\u20090 nylon sutures under an operating microscope with 40 times magnification. One-year postoperative results were evaluated based on upper extremity lymphedema index (UEL index), cellulitis frequency, and subjective symptoms. Twenty-three patients were included. The number of LVAs per limb ranged from 2 to 3 (average, 2). Lymph vessel detection rate was 92.6% (50/54). Ten (43.5%) patients with dermal backflow (DB) showed 19.2% postoperative volume reduction based on UEL index after one year. Thirteen (56.5%) patients without dermal backflow showed only 2% reduction. Postoperative UEL index was significantly lower than preoperative UEL index (123.5\u2009\u00b1\u20097.3\u00a0ml vs. 136.4\u2009\u00b1\u20099.4 ml, P\u2009=\u20090.017). Postoperative cellulitis frequency was decreased compared to preoperative one (2.15\u2009\u00b1\u20090.85 vs. 0.09\u2009\u00b1\u20090.18 attack/year, P \u02c2 0.001). 13(56.5%) patients reported improvement in all subjective symptoms; limb tension improvement in 18 (78.3%) patients, limb heaviness in 15 (65.2%), and overall limb mobility in 13 (56.5%). LVA could be safely and effectively performed in limited resources settings without latest device for lymphatic mapping nor supermicrosurgery instruments. A conventional high-frequency ultrasound allows lymphatic and venous mapping useful for LVA. LVA should not be given up even with limited resources.",

Elucidating the intricate molecular pathways that drive the progression of HCC is imperative for devising targeted and effective therapeutic interventions. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) serve as pivotal regulators of post-transcriptional processes, influencing various cellular functions. This review endeavors to provide a comprehensive analysis of the expression, function, and potential implications of RBPs in HCC. We discuss the classification and diverse roles of RBPs, with a particular focus on key RBPs implicated in HCC and their association with disease progression. Additionally, we explore the mechanisms by which RBPs contribute to HCC, including their impact on gene expression, cell proliferation, cell metastasis, angiogenesis, signaling pathways, and post-transcriptional modifications. Importantly, we examine the potential of RBPs as therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers, offering insights into their relevance in HCC treatment. Finally, we outline future research directions, emphasizing the need for further investigation into the functional mechanisms of RBPs and their clinical translation for personalized HCC therapy. This comprehensive review highlights the pivotal role of RBPs in HCC and their potential as novel therapeutic avenues to improve patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Spermatocytic tumors represent uncommon neoplasms of the testes and are mostly indolent with favorable prognosis in the non-metastatic stage. Rarely, they can undergo sarcomatous transformation, significantly worsening prognosis. This case highlights a patient harboring a testicular spermatocytic tumor and a concomitant sarcoma of the contralateral inguinoscrotal soft tissue, not related to the spermatocytic tumor. A 77-year-old male patient presented with a left scrotal mass and a suspected right inguinoscrotal hernia. Laboratory values showed a slightly elevated alpha-1-fetoprotein, while beta-human chorionic gonadotropin and lactate dehydrogenase were within normal limits. Ultrasound imaging revealed a diffusely enlarged, inhomogeneous left testis, highly suspicious for testicular malignancy. Staging revealed no lymphatic or distant metastases. The patient underwent left radical orchiectomy. Histological analysis revealed a spermatocytic tumor of the left testis. Intraoperatively, a gelatinous mass in the contralateral right inguinoscrotal area was discovered and biopsied. The mass on the right was identified as a sarcomatous tumor. Subsequent management entailed radiotherapy, followed by radical resection and scrotectomy with preperitoneal mesh reinforcement. Pathologic workup including molecular genetic testing showed different immunohistochemical and molecular profiles in both tumors. This led to the final diagnosis of a coexisting undifferentiated sarcoma. Despite being uncommon and generally less aggressive compared to other testicular malignancies, spermatocytic tumors necessitate vigilance for potential sarcomatous transformation. In this case, a sarcomatous transformation of a spermatocytic tumor was excluded and diagnostics instead revealed an even rarer case of a coexisting undifferentiated sarcoma of the contralateral inguinoscrotal soft tissue. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a spermatocytic tumor with a coexisting, unrelated sarcoma. The rarity of these entities underlines the importance of multidisciplinary team meetings for accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment-related decisions.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is highly challenging to treat due to its poor prognosis and limited effective treatment options. Liposomal nanotechnology has emerged as a promising drug delivery platform in oncology, but existing liposomal therapies face limitations such as systemic toxicity, insufficient tumor selectivity, and low target specificity. Mesothelin (MSLN), an antigen overexpressed in PAAD, has attracted attention as a potential target for precision therapy. Here, we present the development of an anti-MSLN nanobody (D3 Nb) with high binding affinity (K<sub>D</sub> = 2.2 nM) that can selectively bind to MSLN-positive cancer cells. Structural analysis revealed that hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds within the complementary determining region (CDR) of D3 Nb promote strong binding to MSLN, leading to significant inhibition of AKT/NF-\u03baB signaling and downregulation of fibronectin 1 (FN1) and twist1, key drivers of PAAD oncogenicity. In vivo studies confirmed that D3 Nb alone inhibits tumor progression. Furthermore, selective delivery to MSLN-positive tumors in combination with gemcitabine-loaded liposomes (D3-LNP-GEM) significantly improved cytotoxicity and promoted tumor regression. These findings highlight the potential of the D3-LNP-GEM platform as a novel targeted therapy for MSLN-expressing malignancies, showing promising efficacy in preclinical models and paving the way for continued clinical evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Talaromycosis has long been considered to be exclusively associated with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). In recent years, with effective control measures for HIV, the number of talaromycosis patients without HIV infection has been increasing annually. All of these patients have various immunosuppressive factors, including tumors. However, we find that talaromycosis among HIV-negative lung cancer patients remains a rarity and is without comprehensive reviews, contributing to significant gaps in clinical knowledge. We report a case of lung squamous cell carcinoma combined with Talaromyces marneffei (T.marneffei) infection in an HIV-negative patient. The patient, a male with a history of long-term smoking, presented with recurrent fever and cough. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans revealed pleural effusion and nodules. The patient was diagnosed with lung squamous cell carcinoma and talaromycosis through sputum cytology and blood/cerebrospinal fluid metagenomics next-generation sequencing (mNGS). The patient underwent only antifungal therapy and succumbed to respiratory failure, liver and kidney failure, and sepsis in January 2024, before receiving any anti-tumor therapy. The mortality rate of talaromycosis combined with lung cancer is extremely high. Therefore, regardless of whether patients have a history of travel to endemic areas of T. marneffei infection, it is crucial to test for HIV and anti-IFN-\u03b3 autoantibodies (AIGA) in patients suspected of having a pulmonary fungal infection, as well as conducting multiple cultures of specimens from different sites and utilizing mNGS to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, it is essential to perform biopsies in various methods from multiple sites to ascertain the presence of lung cancer. With effective control of T. marneffei infection and timely diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer, there can be a significant improvement in patient survival rates.",

    "title": "MUC18-Directed chimeric antigen receptor T cells for the treatment of mucosal melanoma.",
    "abstract": "Mucosal melanoma, a highly aggressive form of skin cancer, remains challenging to manage due to the lack of effective therapies. Mucin 18 (MUC18) is overexpressed in both primary and metastatic lesions of melanoma but rarely in normal tissues. The expression profile makes MUC18 a potential target for development of therapeutic antibodies or chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) cell therapy. This study aims to generate an effective CAR-T targeting MUC18-positive melanoma and evaluate its preclinical antitumor activity. A humanized anti-MUC18 single chain antibody fragment (scFv) was used to construct CAR-T with various designs of the hinge, transmembrane, co-stimulatory, and CD3\u03b6 domains. The antitumor efficacy of MUC18 CAR-T cells was assessed in vitro, in MUC18-positive primary and rechallenged xenograft models, as well as in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of human mucosal melanoma. The humanized scFv selectively bound to MUC18 with high affinity. Various MUC18 CAR-T cells specifically killed MUC18-positive melanoma cells and could proliferate as a result of exposure to antigen. Among them, CAR-T cells containing an IgG4-derived hinge domain and a CD28 co-stimulatory domain demonstrated superior antitumor efficiency. Robust tumor regression and CAR-T cell expansion were observed in multiple MUC18-positive xenograft models after treatment with the IgG4 hinge and CD28 empowered CAR-T cells. This study demonstrated the development of a novel CAR-T therapy for mucosal melanoma, MUC18 CAR-T, that showed strong potency in tumor eradication and inhibition of tumor relapse. This candidate CAR-T therapy could provide a promising strategy for the treatment of the refractory melanoma.",

    "title": "Measuring the paraspinal muscles as an important tool for predicting the overall survival period after spine surgery in lung cancer patients with spine metastasis.",
    "abstract": "Retrospective cohort study BACKGROUND: Metastatic lung cancer in the spine is difficult to determine whether to perform an additional surgical intervention, as patients at the end stage of lung cancer often have low performance status with significant muscle atrophy. This study aimed to demonstrate whether sarcopenia affects the prognosis after spine surgery in lung cancer patients by measuring the paraspinal muscles. A total of 65 lung cancer patients who underwent spine surgery were reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups based on the survival period after surgery (\u2264\u20096\u00a0months; n\u2009=\u200933 and\u2009>\u20096\u00a0months; n\u2009=\u200932). Based on magnetic resonance imaging, the quantity and quality of the paraspinal muscles (psoas major, quadratus lumborum, erector spinae, and multifidus) were analyzed by an Image J program. Patient- and surgery-related factors were compared between the two groups. The quantity of the erector spinae muscle was higher in the\u2009>\u20096\u00a0months group (11.5\u2009\u00b1\u20092.8 cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>) than in the\u2009\u2264\u20096\u00a0months group (10.0\u2009\u00b1\u20092.3 cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>, p\u2009=\u20090.013). The logistic regression analysis showed that the muscle quantity of the erector spinae (p\u2009=\u20090.026, odds ratio 1.343) and the number of vertebrae involved in metastasis (p\u2009=\u20090.016, odds ratio 0.199) were the main prognostic factors for the survival period after spine surgery. Lung cancer patients with a low quantity of the erector spinae muscles are at a high risk of poor prognosis after spine surgery. Therefore, measuring the erector spinae muscle could be an important tool for distinguishing patients appropriate for palliative treatments and surgical interventions.",

    "title": "Psychosocial challenges among Asian adolescents and young adults with cancer: a scoping review.",
    "abstract": "Most of the landmark cohorts and reviews that assessed the psychosocial outcomes among adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors have focused on Western populations. This scoping review summarizes the existing evidence on psychosocial challenges experienced by AYAs with cancer in Asia, specifically work- and school-related outcomes, financial distress, social relationships, and concerns with infertility. A literature search was conducted on Embase and Medline for studies that (1) were published in English between 2000 and 2023, (2) recruited AYAs diagnosed with cancer between the age of 15 and 39 years, (3) were conducted in Asia, and (4) assessed outcomes related to (i) work or/and school performance, (ii) financial distress, (iii) romantic relationship or/and relationship with family and peers, and (iii) concerns with childbirth and infertility. Titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened independently by two reviewers to identify eligible studies. Information of included studies was summarized and aggregated using structured forms based on Joanna Briggs Institute's (JBI) data extraction form. Both quantitative and qualitative studies were assessed for methodological validity using JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist. Thirteen studies, enrolling a total of 1,108 survivors, reported outcomes related to work or school performance (n\u2009=\u20098), relationships with families and peers (n\u2009=\u20095), and desires or concerns regarding childbirth or infertility (n\u2009=\u20095). Although no differences in resignation rates between AYA survivors of cancer and non-cancer controls or other age groups were reported in three studies, 21%-40% of AYAs expressed concerns regarding employment or impaired work outcomes after cancer diagnosis. Studies identified health concerns and socioenvironmental factors that affected family functioning and romantic relationships. The uncertainty and the lack of information on fertility preservation were consistently reported by participants. Our review demonstrated differences in concerns and disparities in social support and interventions available to AYA cancer survivors among various Asian countries/regions. We found Asian studies have focused more on family relationships than peers, likely due to sociocultural nuances when compared with Western societies. Given the variability in economic development and healthcare infrastructure across Asia, region-specific healthcare policies and services are required for AYA survivors.",

    "title": "Modified extracorporeal traction with wires: a method for steering the liver for laparoscopic resection of hepatic tumors in segment 7 (with video).",
    "abstract": "Laparoscopic hepatectomy is a less traumatic, minimally invasive procedure that has been widely used to address liver tumors because of its association with a faster recovery and less bleeding. Although adequate exposure and transposition of the liver ensure a clear surgical field and a successful operation, tumors in S7 present a challenge in that surgeons experience difficulty in exposing such tumors and the operating space is small. We used a modified extracorporeal traction with wires method for use in minimally invasive hepatic resection surgery to improve visibility of the surgical field and therefore reduce the difficulty of surgery. The method involved adjusting the traction force appropriately for transposition of the liver. We reviewed data from 15 laparoscopic hepatic tumor resections performed between January and November 2024. In this paper, we describe the surgical and traction techniques used and evaluate the intraoperative and postoperative course. The study population consisted of 9 males and 6 females, and the median mean age was 61.84\u2009\u00b1\u200911.08 years (Table\u00a01). The median body mass index was 25.65\u2009\u00b1\u20093.14\u00a0kg/m2, the median tumor size was 3.78\u2009\u00b1\u20092.09\u00a0cm, the median operative time was 154.09\u2009\u00b1\u200931.97\u00a0min, the median intraoperative blood loss volume was 115.36\u2009\u00b1\u200951.26\u00a0ml, and the median hospitalization time was 10.33\u2009\u00b1\u20092.09 days.No serious intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred, and R0 resection was achieved in all cases. Morevoer, in all cases, the time to set up bandwire extracorporeal traction was less than 3\u00a0min. The bandwire traction technique can provide a more stable surgical field, shorten the surgical time, and reduce the likelihood of surgical trauma. The technique allows safe transposition of the liver and plays an important role in minimally invasive resection of hepatic tumors, highlighting its suitability for widespread clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "There is a lack of epidemiological surveys on soft tissue sarcoma (STS) worldwide. This study aims to assess the global disease burden of soft tissue sarcoma in 204 countries and regions. We analyzed the incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of STS based on the data provided by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study, and assessed the trends in disease burden across different regions, sexes, and age groups. At the same time, we used the Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort (BAPC) model to predict the development trend of the global disease burden of STS. Globally, over the past 30 years, the number of STS cases has increased from 54,630.92 in 1990 to 96,200.96 in 2021, while the age-standardized incidence rate has decreased by 0.05 per 100,000 people during this period. The age-standardized incidence rate and DALYs rate have respectively declined by 0.14 per 100,000 people and 6.86 years per 100,000 people. In 21 GBD regions, there is a significant positive correlation between Socio-Demographic Index(SDI) and incidence rate (R\u2009=\u20090.4730, P\u2009<\u20090.0001). It is projected that the number of STS cases will peak in 2033, reaching 95,591.93 people. The disease burden of STS has been decreasing, especially regarding mortality and DALYs rates. It's more prevalent in developed regions, males, and older. Focused medical prevention and health measures for these groups can help reduce the global disease burden.",

    "abstract": "Esophageal cancer (EC), particularly esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), is a major global health issue with high incidence and mortality rates in Asia. This study examines the impact of occupational background on the long-term survival of ESCC patients following esophagectomy. Data were obtained from the Sichuan Cancer Hospital & Institute Esophageal Cancer Case Management Database (SCCH-ECCM Database), focusing on patients with ESCC who underwent esophagectomy between 2010 and 2017. Patients were classified into four occupational groups: Farmer, Civil Servant, Teacher, and Factory Worker. The primary outcome measured was overall survival (OS), which was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, Cox proportional hazards models, and restricted mean survival time (RMST). To account for potential confounding factors, propensity score matching (PSM) was employed. Among the cohort, 67.5% were Farmers, 9.0% Civil Servants, 1.9% Teachers, and 21.6% Factory Workers. The median follow-up was 72.2\u00a0months, with a median OS of 49.8\u00a0months. One-, three-, and five-year OS rates varied slightly by occupation, with Factory Workers displaying the highest one-year survival rate at 91%. Significant survival differences were noted between Farmers and Civil Servants (HR: 1.291; 95% CI: 1.030\u2009-\u20091.618; P\u2009=\u20090.027),the significance persisted even after PSM (HR: 1.376; 95% CI: 1.004\u2009-\u20091.885; P\u2009=\u20090.047). Civil Servants, who presented with more advanced disease stages, had the lowest crude RMST, aligning more closely with other groups after adjustment. The results revealed that ESCC patients categorized as Civil Servants exhibited a poorer prognosis compared to those classified as Farmers.",

    "title": "Associations between patient sociodemographic characteristics and lack of treatment for locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma: results from a complete nationwide, unselected, real-world register study in Denmark.",
    "abstract": "Previous studies have investigated treatment patterns among patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) in Denmark and found that, in an unselected nationwide Danish registry cohort, only 36% of patients received systemic anticancer therapy. The objective of this study was to identify socioeconomic factors associated with the receipt of systemic treatment in patients with mUC in Denmark, a country with universal free access to healthcare. This retrospective, population-based study was based on data from the Danish national healthcare registers. We identified all patients diagnosed with mUC from 2010 to 2017 who were potentially eligible for systemic chemotherapy (cohort 1). Two sub-cohorts of interest were identified: patients who received systemic anticancer treatment (cohort 2) and patients who did not receive any systemic anticancer treatment or surgery following the diagnosis of mUC (cohort 3). A total of 3,206 patients diagnosed with mUC were identified (cohort 1), of whom 1,223 (38%) did not meet the study inclusion criteria (i.e., received treatments other than those pre-specified). For patients who received systemic anticancer treatment (cohort 2; n\u2009=\u20091,141 [36%]), the mean time to treatment was 1.3 months. Among untreated patients (cohort 3; n\u2009=\u2009842 [26%]), 246 patients died within 1.3 months after the diagnosis of metastatic disease; thus, to account for immortal time bias, these 246 patients were excluded from analyses. Comparing the remaining 596 patients in cohort 3 with all patients in cohort 2, increasing age and region of residence were found to be associated with a lower probability of receiving systemic treatment. Moreover, completion of at least a high school education and being married were associated with a higher probability of receiving systemic treatment. We found significant and measurable inequality in access to treatment for mUC. Among other factors, residence in two relatively rural regions was associated with lower probability of receiving systemic anticancer treatment compared to residence in other regions. In addition, marital status and education level had a significant impact on treatment rates.",

    "abstract": "Metastatic prostate cancer is commonly treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and chemotherapy, which often leads to treatment resistance and disease progression with limited effective interventions. Recent advances in robotic surgery and precision radiotherapy have prompted research into comprehensive treatments for low-burden metastatic prostate cancer, particularly oligometastatic prostate cancer (OMPC). Our phase I/II clinical study confirmed the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant radiotherapy combined with endocrine therapy before radical prostatectomy, warranting further investigation. This study protocol outlines a prospective, open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled trial to evaluate preoperative neoadjuvant radiohormonal therapy versus standard care in OMPC. The experimental group receives LHRHa, abiraterone, IMRT for pelvic lesions, and SBRT for extrapelvic lesions, followed by RARP and lymph node dissection. The control group receives long-term LHRHa and abiraterone. The primary endpoint is 3-year failure-free survival (FFS), and secondary endpoints include time to CRPC, 2-year FFS, OS, TRG rating, and complications. This trial is the first to assess whether neoadjuvant radiohormonal therapy with robotic prostatectomy offers better prognostic outcomes than long-term endocrine therapy alone for OMPC. The results aim to provide high-level evidence for this approach, potentially influencing future treatment protocols. The study has been registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05707468).

    "abstract": "Small cell carcinoma (SmCC) of the bladder is a rare and aggressive malignancy. Characterizing transcription factor (TF)-defined subtypes may provide insights into its biology and inform targeted therapies. This study investigates lineage-specific TF expression in bladder SmCC, its association with clinicopathological features, and comparisons with prostate SmCC. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 9 cases of bladder SmCC and 6 cases of prostate SmCC diagnosed at a single cancer hospital in Japan. Immunohistochemistry was performed for lineage-specific TFs (ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3, and YAP1) and neuroendocrine and other markers. Statistical comparisons were made using Fisher's exact test and independent samples t-tests. Combined SmCC morphology, including urothelial carcinoma (UC) (5 cases) and adenocarcinoma (2 cases), was more frequent in bladder SmCC than in prostate SmCC (78% [7 of 9 cases] vs. 17% [1 of 6 cases], p\u2009=\u20090.041). NEUROD1 was more frequently expressed in bladder SmCC than in prostate SmCC (67% [6 of 9 cases] vs. 0% [0 of 6 cases]; p\u2009=\u20090.028). NEUROD1 expression was more frequent in combined SmCC and UC bladder tumors than in other bladder SmCC tumors (100% [5 of 5 cases] vs. 25% [1 of 4 cases], p\u2009=\u20090.048). Conversely, HNF4A expression was absent in all combined SmCC and UC bladder tumors (0 of 5) but present in 75% (3 of 4) of other bladder SmCC tumors (p\u2009=\u20090.048). In 2 cases of bladder SmCC, NEUROD1 and POU2F3 were expressed in a mutually exclusive manner, with neuroendocrine markers expressed only in the NEUROD1-expressing component. NEUROD1 is characteristically expressed in bladder SmCC, especially in SmCC combined with UC, suggesting a distinct phenotype from prostate SmCC. These findings highlight the potential for TF-based classification to improve diagnostic accuracy and inform therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound elastography in differentiating between malignant and benign breast microcalcifications through a case-control study. A total of 300 female patients were enrolled in this study, equally divided between malignant (n\u2009=\u2009150) and benign (n\u2009=\u2009150) microcalcification groups. The malignant cases were histologically confirmed as ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast cancer, while benign cases were confirmed through histology or follow-up as fibroadenoma, fibrocystic changes, or benign calcifications. Ultrasound elastography parameters, including elastic modulus (kPa), strain ratio, and elasticity scores, were measured and compared between groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors, and diagnostic performance was evaluated using ROC curve analysis. Malignant lesions demonstrated significantly higher mean elasticity values compared to benign lesions (88.3\u2009\u00b1\u200916.2\u00a0kPa vs. 45.7\u2009\u00b1\u20099.8\u00a0kPa, P\u2009<\u20090.001). The strain ratio and elasticity scores were also significantly elevated in the malignant group (both P\u2009<\u20090.001). Multivariate analysis identified elastic modulus (OR\u2009=\u20091.09, 95%CI: 1.06-1.12, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and strain ratio (OR\u2009=\u20092.50, 95%CI: 1.70-3.80, P\u2009<\u20090.001) as independent predictors of malignancy. Using an optimal cutoff value of 62\u00a0kPa for elasticity, the diagnostic sensitivity was 88.0% (95%CI: 81.5-92.8%) and specificity was 86.7% (95%CI: 79.5-91.9%), with an accuracy of 89.0%. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for elasticity alone was 0.95 (95%CI: 0.92-0.98), which improved to 0.97 (95%CI: 0.94-0.99) when combined with strain ratio (P\u2009=\u20090.018). High interobserver agreement was demonstrated (Kappa\u2009=\u20090.84, 95%CI: 0.79-0.88), and Bland-Altman analysis confirmed excellent measurement reliability. Ultrasound elastography demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy in differentiating between malignant and benign breast microcalcifications, with excellent reproducibility and reliability. The combination of elasticity values and strain ratio provides superior diagnostic performance compared to single parameters alone, suggesting its potential as a valuable tool in clinical practice for the evaluation of breast microcalcifications.",

    "abstract": "Cervical cancer is the most common malignant tumor of the reproductive tract in women and poses a serious threat to their health. Cervical cancer screening is primarily conducted through the detection of HPV or cytological examination. In this study, we analyzed the prevalence, genotyping of HPV, and cervical cytology among women in Shannan city, Tibet, China, between 2021 and 2022, to guide the prevention of cervical cancer among local women. This is the first large-scale cervical cytology screening study conducted in the southern region of the province. Between January 2021 and December 2022, 15,493 women participated in HPV genotype testing, and 16,775 women underwent ThinPrep cytologic tests. HPV prevalence and genotype distribution were analyzed for the entire population. Furthermore, the samples were stratified by age group and altitude to analyze the HPV infection rate and distribution of cervical cytological abnormalities. The prevalence of HPV in Shannan city was 7.91%, with HPV16 and HPV18 affecting 1.21%. Single infections (95.92%) were more common than multiple infections (4.08%). The overall HPV infection rate peaked in the cohort\u2009<\u200925 years of age (13.25%). Furthermore, HPV infection rates and cervical cell abnormalities varied according to the administrative division in Shannan city, and this difference was attributed to various altitudes. Among HPV carriers, the infection rate peaks in women aged 25 years, after which it declined annually, and the probability of coinfection is relatively low. Additionally, we found that high-altitude areas exhibited elevated HPV prevalence but fewer cervical abnormalities, suggesting complex environmental, genetic, and cultural influences on infection and disease progression. Based on these data, effective recommendations can be made for cervical cancer screening and HPV prevention in local communities.",

    "title": "Cannabidiol as a novel therapeutic agent in breast cancer: evidence from literature.",
    "abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide, posing significant challenges due to its heterogeneity and the emergence of drug resistance. Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive compound derived from Cannabis sativa, has recently gained attention for its potential therapeutic effects in breast cancer. This review aims to evaluate the antitumor effects of CBD in breast cancer treatment by synthesizing preclinical and clinical evidence, elucidating its mechanisms of action, and exploring its translational potential. A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search was performed across PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, using keywords such as \"Cannabidiol,\" \"CBD,\" \"Breast Cancer,\" \"Therapeutic Agent,\" and \"Antitumor Effects.\" A total of 1,191 articles were initially identified. After duplicate removal and eligibility screening, 34 studies published between 1998 and 2025 were selected, including in vitro, in vivo, and clinical investigations. Studies were assessed based on PRISMA recommendations, considering inclusion criteria such as CBD's impact on apoptosis, cell proliferation, tumor progression, and molecular mechanisms. CBD demonstrated significant anticancer effects, including induction of apoptosis, inhibition of cell proliferation, suppression of metastasis, and modulation of the tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, CBD modulates key pathways such as PI3K/Akt, mTOR, and PPAR\u03b3 and interacts with CB1, CB2, and non-cannabinoid receptors. Preclinical studies showed CBD's efficacy, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), while limited clinical trials highlighted its potential as an adjunct to conventional therapies. CBD offers a promising therapeutic approach for breast cancer, especially for aggressive subtypes like TNBC. However, challenges such as variability in study design, lack of standardized protocols, and limited clinical validation hinder its clinical application. Future research should focus on conducting robust clinical trials, identifying predictive biomarkers, and optimizing combinatorial therapies to integrate CBD into personalized cancer treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies in men. Once prostate cancer advances to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), the 5-year survival rate can decrease to as low as 14\u00a0months. However, the current primary diagnostic method, PSA testing, is associated with a lengthy detection cycle, limited accuracy, and delays in identifying disease progression. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop an imaging technique that enables early and accurate diagnosis of CRPC. First, immunofluorescence was used to verify that the expression of NRP2 on endothelial cells of neovasculature increased with the progression of prostate cancer. Next, NRP2-modified microbubbles (MBs<sub>NRP2</sub>) were prepared, and their specific targeting ability to endothelial cells was validated through parallel plate flow experiments. Subsequently, co-culture systems of prostate cancer cells and endothelial cells were established. Based on this, the proangiogenic effect of prostate cancer was systematically explored, and the differential expression of NRP2 was analyzed. A combination of immunofluorescence localization, flow cytometry, western blotting, and angiogenesis assays was used. Finally, in a subcutaneous tumor-bearing mouse model, ultrasound molecular imaging (USMI) was implemented, and the ultrasound contrast intensity of attached MBs<sub>NRP2</sub> was monitored and quantitatively analyzed. This study confirmed the clear colocalization of NRP2 with CD31 in prostate cancer tissues. Secondly, MBs<sub>NRP2</sub> exhibited specific binding ability under dynamic conditions to microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1). Subsequently, with the progression of CRPC, the expression of NRP2 on HMEC-1 cells gradually increased, accompanied by a significant enhancement in their angiogenic capacity. Lastly, compared with control mice, the USMI signals in tumor-bearing mice from the hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC), non metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC), and metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) groups were significantly increased. This finding provides a potential new pathway for clinical diagnosis of the development of CRPC. Regarding the progression of prostate cancer, the expression of NRP2 on neovascular endothelial cells gradually increases, potentially serving as a molecular target for early diagnosis of CRPC. The attached MBs<sub>NRP2</sub> intensity has significant differences in prostate cancer models at different stages. These findings suggest that ultrasound contrast imaging based on MBs<sub>NRP2</sub> could be a novel strategy for the early diagnosis of CRPC.",

    "title": "Integrated multi-omics reveal lactate metabolism-related gene signatures and PYGL in predicting HNSCC prognosis and immunotherapy efficacy.",
    "abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treatment faces significant clinical challenges. Lactate metabolism plays a crucial role in the initiation of many cancers and the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the prognostic significance of lactate metabolism-related genes (LMRGs) and the role of TME in HNSCC require further elucidation. We built a prognostic multigene signature with LMRGs and systematically correlated the risk signature with immunological characteristics and immunotherapy efficacy. Next, a series of single-cell sequencing analyses were used to characterize lactate metabolism in TME. Finally, single-cell sequencing analysis, immunofluorescence analyses, and a series of in vitro experiments were used to explore the role of PYGL in HNSCC. Potential drugs targeting PYGL were screened using AutoDock 4.2. A prognostic multigene signature based on LMRGs was developed, which effectively stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups, with significant differences in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Patients in the low-risk group exhibited reduced lactate metabolism, higher CD8\u2009+\u2009T cell infiltration, and improved response to immunotherapy. Single-cell sequencing revealed that tumor cells had the most active lactate metabolism compared to other cells in the TME. PYGL, identified as the most critical prognostic gene, was highly expressed in tumor-associated macrophages and played a role in inhibiting M1 macrophage polarization. Knockdown of PYGL led to reduced lactate levels, and its expression was inversely correlated with CD8\u2009+\u2009T cell infiltration. Furthermore, PYGL was involved in copper-dependent cell death, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. Drug screening identified elesclomol, which showed promising results in PYGL-knockdown cells. The study established a robust LMRGs-based prognostic model that not only predicts patient survival but also correlates with the immune microenvironment in HNSCC. PYGL emerged as a key biomarker with significant implications for both prognosis and therapeutic intervention. Its role in regulating lactate metabolism and immune suppression suggests that targeting PYGL could enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies. This research provides a foundation for future clinical strategies aimed at improving outcomes in HNSCC by modulating the tumor's metabolic and immune landscapes.",

    "abstract": "The serratus posterior superior intercostal plane block (SPSIPB) is a newly described truncal block. This study aimed to compare the effects of SPSIPB with conventional methods on postoperative opioid consumption and pain scores within 24\u00a0h postoperatively. This randomized controlled trial included 60 patients aged 18-65 years with an American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status of I-III. Patients were randomly assigned to either the SPSIPB or the control group. The primary outcome was cumulative opioid consumption within the first 24\u00a0h postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included resting and dynamic Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain scores, Quality of Recovery (QoR)-15 questionnaire scores, intraoperative remifentanil consumption, and the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Total tramadol consumption was significantly lower in the SPSIPB group during the first 12\u00a0h and at the end of the 24th hour postoperatively compared with the control group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The dynamic NRS score at 0\u00a0h postoperatively was lower in the SPSIPB group (p\u2009=\u20090.001), whereas no significant differences in NRS scores were observed at other time-points. The postoperative QoR-15 scores were significantly higher in the SPSIPB group compared with the control group. Furthermore, the SPSIPB group had significantly lower intraoperative remifentanil consumption (p\u2009=\u20090.003). Nausea and vomiting were more frequent at 12 and 24\u00a0h postoperatively in the control group compared with the SPSIPB group. Serratus posterior superior intercostal plane block significantly reduced opioid use, and improved recovery quality after oncoplastic breast surgery. NCT06225908, registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer (LC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with chemotherapy significantly extends survival but increases the risk of treatment-related toxicity. To explore the impact of adding pembrolizumab to pemetrexed and platinum on treatment-related toxicity, this study utilized the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to assess the safety of pemetrexed and platinum with or without pembrolizumab in LC patients. We collected data from FAERS database between the second quarter of 2017 and the third quarter of 2024. Disproportionality analysis was conducted using the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), and Multi-Item Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS). Additionally, comparative analysis was performed using the ROR method. Among LC patients receiving chemotherapy alone (pemetrexed\u2009+\u2009platinum) and combination therapy (pembrolizumab\u2009+\u2009pemetrexed\u2009+\u2009platinum), adverse event (AE) reports were 2871 and 5443 cases, respectively. Compared to chemotherapy alone, combination therapy was associated with a higher risk of renal and urinary disorders, hepatobiliary disorders, and interstitial lung disease (ILD), pneumonitis and other AEs. Subgroup analysis revealed that gender and age may be influential factors in the occurrence of AEs. Combination therapy prolonged the time to onset of AEs. In the real world, combination therapy increases the risk of certain AEs, particularly in specific patient subgroups. These findings emphasize the importance of personalized treatment strategies and AE monitoring, particularly during the first three months of therapy.",

Evidence suggests that abnormal immune system can lead to immune dysfunction and increase the risk of developing diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). This study investigated the abnormality of MDSCs in the peripheral blood of patients with DLBCL. Expression, apoptosis, and proliferation of MDSCs was measured in the peripheral blood DLBCL patients and healthy donors (HDs) via flow cytometer. The co-culture groups included the MDSCs and DLBCL cells line and MDSCs and T cells. Using flow cytometry detected MDSCs and T cells proliferation, apoptosis, T cells activation and function in the co-culture groups. RNA transcriptome sequencing analysis was conducted on DLBCL-MDSCs and HDs-MDSCs. Combined with the clinicopathological data of DLBCL patients, the correlation between MDSCs and DLBCL progression was analyzed. The expression of MDSCs in patients newly diagnosed with DLBCL was elevated. DLBCL tumor cells could stimulate MDSCs growth. DLBCL-MDSCs showed stronger immunosuppressive ability to T cells proliferation, activation and secretion of cytokines and associated with several clinical indicators such as Ann Arbor stage, serum LDH level, and lymphoma IPI score. This study investigated the abnormality of MDSCs and underscored the critical role of MDSCs in suppressing T cell function in DLBCL patients. It provides certain laboratory evidence for MDSCs as biomarkers of disease progression and treatment response in DLBCL.",

This study aimed to investigate the causal relationship between various endocrine diseases-specifically type 2 diabetes, obesity, diabetic hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hyperthyroidism-and lymphoid malignancies, including lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with subtypes like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. Utilizing data from genome-wide association studies, a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis was performed. The primary approach involved the inverse-variance weighted method, supplemented by other robust techniques such as the weighted median and MR-Egger regression to ensure reliability. The analysis indicated a significant causal connection between genetically predicted diabetic hypoglycemia and lymphocytic leukemia (Odds ratio\u2009=\u20091.0004, 95% Confidence interval\u2009=\u20091-1.0007, P\u2009=\u20090.03). Conversely, no associations were found for the other endocrine diseases with lymphoid malignancies (P\u2009>\u20090.05 for all). The findings suggest that while diabetic hypoglycemia may influence lymphocytic leukemia risk, further research is necessary to clarify the roles of other endocrine diseases in lymphoid malignancies, including cross-population validations and biological investigations.",

The process of efferocytosis has been confirmed to be closely associated with tumor progression and microenvironment remodeling. Nevertheless, the mechanism of efferocytosis in GC remains unclear. This study integrates single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets with the TCGA transcriptome data for GC, focusing on the expression and distribution of efferocytosis-related genes (ERGs) at the single-cell level in GC. The prognostic features of ERGs are determined by Cox and LASSO analysis. And we analyzed and evaluated the differences between the two groups of patients in terms of long-term prognosis, immune infiltration, expression of immune checkpoints, and response to chemotherapeutic drugs. Seven cell types were identified from 10 GC samples. ERGs were mainly concentrated in macrophages, dividing macrophages into 5 cell subtypes. LASSO combined with Cox ultimately confirmed 4 independent prognostic genes, and a prognostic nomogram was constructed based on gene risk scores and clinical features, which was validated in an independent dataset. Further studies revealed that ERGs were closely related to the patient's immune cell infiltration (especially M2 macrophages), immunotherapy response, and drug sensitivity. We developed an ERG-based predictive model that could serve as a valuable tool for prognosis assessment and decision support in the context of immunotherapy and chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Cachexia, a severe wasting syndrome characterized by tumour-induced metabolic dysregulation, is a leading cause of death in people with cancer, yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we show that a longitudinal full-body single-nuclei-resolution transcriptome analysis in a Drosophila model of cancer cachexia captures interorgan dysregulations. Our study reveals that the tumour-secreted interleukin-like cytokine Upd3 induces fat-body expression of Pepck1 and Pdk, key regulators of gluconeogenesis, disrupting glucose metabolism and contributing to cachexia. Similarly, in mouse cancer cachexia models, we observe IL-6-JAK-STAT-signalling-mediated induction of Pck1 and Pdk3 expression in the liver. Increased expression of these genes in fly, mouse, and human correlates with poor prognosis, and hepatic expression of Pdk3 emerges as a previously unknown mechanism contributing to metabolic dysfunction in cancer cachexia. This study highlights the conserved nature of tumour-induced metabolic disruptions and identifies potential therapeutic targets to mitigate cachexia in people with cancer.",

    "title": "Variational mode directed deep learning framework for breast lesion classification using ultrasound imaging.",
    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer and the second cause of cancer related death among women in the United States. Accurate and early detection of breast cancer can reduce the number of mortalities. Recent works explore deep learning techniques with ultrasound for detecting malignant breast lesions. However, the lack of explanatory features, need for segmentation, and high computational complexity limit their applicability in this detection. Therefore, we propose a novel ultrasound-based breast lesion classification framework that utilizes two-dimensional variational mode decomposition (2D-VMD) which provides self-explanatory features for guiding a convolutional neural network (CNN) with mixed pooling and attention mechanisms. The visual inspection of these features demonstrates their explainability in terms of discriminative lesion-specific boundary and texture in the decomposed modes of benign and malignant images, which further guide the deep learning network for enhanced classification. The proposed framework can classify the lesions with accuracies of 98% and 93% in two public breast ultrasound datasets and 89% in an in-house dataset without having to segment the lesions unlike existing techniques, along with an optimal trade-off between the sensitivity and specificity. 2D-VMD improves the areas under the receiver operating characteristics and precision-recall curves by 5% and 10% respectively. The proposed method achieves relative improvement of 14.47%(8.42%) (mean (SD)) in accuracy over state-of-the-art methods for one public dataset, and 5.75%(4.52%) for another public dataset with comparable performance to two existing methods. Further, it is computationally efficient with a reduction of [Formula: see text] in floating point operations as compared to existing methods.",

Despite SEC14L3's known roles in cellular signaling, its involvement in HCC progression and cuproptosis regulation is unclear. Here, we reveal that SEC14L3 expression is downregulated in HCC cells and tissues and correlates with advanced stages and poor prognosis. Copper-induced cuproptosis inhibits HCC cell viability, and SEC14L3 positively modulates cuproptosis in HCC cells by promoting DLAT lipoylation and its oligomerization. Mechanistically, SEC14L3-mediated cuproptosis suppressed HCC growth via the ERK/YY1/FDX1 axis both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, copper enhanced the SEC14L3 expression, which in turn regulated ERK/YY1/FDX1 axis.

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with incidence rates projected to double between 2020 and 2040. This growing health challenge highlights the need for improved diagnostic strategies and risk assessment tools to better understand disease etiology and progression. Among environmental factors, heavy metals have been implicated in inflammation and carcinogenesis, yet their specific role in prostate disease remains insufficiently explored. This novel study analyses the relationship between heavy metal concentrations in plasma and urine of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, precancerous lesions and prostate cancer. In addition to evaluating key clinical parameters, including age, total PSA levels, hemoglobin concentrations and monocyte/lymphocyte ratio, it aims to determine whether specific heavy metals contribute to the progression of prostate disease and whether they can serve as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis. Our findings reveal significant differences in vanadium and antimony concentrations in plasma, suggesting a potential role in prostate disease pathophysiology. Notably, lower plasma antimony concentrations are associated with an increased risk of PC, while plasma vanadium concentrations are significantly higher in the PL group. Regression analysis further supports the association between heavy metal concentrations and the risk of PL and PC, highlighting the potential of vanadium and copper as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for prostate health. The study also explores the impact of lead exposure on prostate cancer risk, revealing a significant association between urine lead concentration and PC. These findings underscore the complex interaction between heavy metal concentrations and prostate disease risk, emphasizing the need for further research to elucidate underlying mechanisms and explore therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Despite the development of mutant-selective KRAS inhibitors, colorectal cancer (CRC) responses remain limited, with stable disease and rapid recurrence being common outcomes. The molecular mechanisms enabling CRC cells to tolerate KRAS inhibition and ultimately develop resistance remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated early transcriptional and proteomic responses to KRAS silencing in 3D CRC cell line spheroid models, aiming to identify pathways associated with sensitivity or resistance to KRAS blockade. Cell lines were stratified into KRAS silencing-sensitive (HCT116 and SW480) and -resistant (LS174T and SW837) groups based on spheroid growth, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis induction. Transcriptional profiling revealed the unfolded protein response (UPR) and WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling as pathways specifically upregulated in KRAS silencing-sensitive cells and downregulated in resistant cells. Proteomic analysis of membrane-enriched fractions further supported UPR deregulation, showing a pronounced downregulation of translation-related proteins in sensitive cells. Functional assays validated that the sensitive cell line HCT116 exhibits reduced protein aggregation and lower translational capacity upon KRAS knockdown, consistent with UPR activation. Pharmacological inhibition of IRE1\u03b1-mediated UPR signaling did not revert KRAS silencing-induced cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in this cell line. Collectively, our results highlight the UPR activation as an early adaptive response of KRAS-dependent CRC cells to KRAS silencing.",

    "title": "Improved SwinUNet with fusion transformer and large kernel convolutional attention for liver and tumor segmentation in CT images.",
    "abstract": "Segmentation of both liver and liver tumors is a critical step in radiation therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite numerous algorithms have been proposed for organ and tumor delineation, automatic segmentation of livers and liver tumors remains a challenge due to their blurred boundaries and low tissue contrast compared to surrounding organs within CT images. The U-Net-based methods have achieved significant success in this task. However, they often suffer from the limitation that feature extraction lacks relationships, i.e., context, among adjacent areas, thereby leading to uncertainty in segmentation results. To address with this challenge, we incorporate both global-local context and attention into the Swin-UNet. Firstly, we introduce a Swin-neighborhood Fusion Transformer Block (SFTB) to capture both global and local context in an image, enabling us to distinguish instances and their boundaries effectively. Secondly, we design a Large-kernel Convolutional Attention Block (LCAB) with two types of attention to highlight crucial features. Experiments on the LiTS and 3D-IRCADb datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, with dice scores of 0.9559 and 0.9610 for liver segmentation, and 0.7614 and 0.7138 for liver tumor segmentation.

    "abstract": "There are different side effects in radiotherapy of head and neck cancer (HNC) including xerostomia. The present study utilizes the addition of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]-weighted Magnetic Resonance (MR) radiomic image features to typical Computed Tomography (CT)-based features and radiation dose-based characteristics and incorporates the evaluation and validation of individual and ensemble classifiers for prediction of early-onset xerostomia in radiotherapy of HNC. A total of 80 patients diagnosed with HNC were evaluated prospectively. The dataset was divided into two subsets: 70% for training and validation and 30% for testing. Stratified random sampling was used to ensure that the proportion of xerostomia cases was consistent across both subsets. This approach preserved the class balance and ensured a representative distribution of demographic, dosimetric, and radiomic features in both sets. MR and CT imaging, dosimetric, and demographic features of patients were used as model input data. Bilateral parotid radiomic features were extracted from CT, [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] weighted MR images. Pearson statistical tests were used for selection of features and Random Tree (RT), Neural Network (NN), Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) and Bayesian Network (BN) classifiers were evaluated. To prevent overfitting and data leakage, preprocessing was conducted. All features were normalized using the z-score technique, with the mean and standard deviation calculated from the training set and then applied to the test set. For the training dataset, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was used to balance the minority class. The results suggest the extracted features from [Formula: see text] weighted images have superior prediction ability compared to [Formula: see text] weighted acquisitions. The RT and BN models based on [Formula: see text] weighted images show better performance than those obtained with [Formula: see text] weighted images. [Formula: see text] weighted image-based analysis shows area under the curve (AUC) values for The RT and BN models of 0.90 and 0.84, respectively, while corresponding values obtained from [Formula: see text] weighted images are 0.79 and 0.78 for RT and BN models respectively. Combined [Formula: see text] weighted image-based models RT-BN, RT-LSVM-BN and RT-NN-LSVM-BN also show good performance having AUC values 0.97, 0.92, and 0.90, respectively. These results show that radiomic features from MR images obtained before radiotherapy can be used in addition to other metrics as personalized and unique biomarkers for prediction of early-onset xerostomia. Ensemble classifiers are more efficient than individual classifiers in prediction of early xerostomia.",

    "abstract": "Among central nervous system (CNS) tumors, gliomas are the most prevalent type of tumor. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene have been identified as risk loci for gliomas by previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We examined association between TERT variants and glioma risk in a Korean population. For a case-control study, a total of 32 TERT SNPs from 317 patients with glioma and 480 population-based controls were genotyped. Logistic regression was used for statistical analysis of the link between TERT SNPs and risk of glioma. In this study, eight TERT variants, including four glioma-associated variants reported in previous studies, showed significant association with the risk of glioma. Conditional and stepwise analyses were conducted to validate independent associations in the group of the eight variants. Both analyses identified an intronic variant (rs56345976) as the causal variant among the eight variants. Glioma subgroup analyses indicate that rs56345976 variant is associated with the risk of WHO grade 4, glioblastoma, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type, and 1p/19q non-codeletion glioma. This study presents a profound comprehension of the relationship between TERT variants and the risk of glioma. Further studies of this variant are required to investigate its effect on glioma susceptibility.",

    "title": "Bio-barrier-adaptable biomimetic nanomedicines combined with ultrasound for enhanced cancer therapy.",
    "abstract": "Addressing the critical biological barriers of targeted accumulation and deep tumor penetration remains essential for the clinical translation of nanomedicines. However, existing nanomedicines often face challenges during in vivo transportation, including immune clearance, tumor microenvironmental barriers, and limited vascular permeability, which collectively reduce drug delivery efficiency and compromise therapeutic efficacy. Here, we present a bio-barrier-adaptable biomimetic nanoplatform, MSF@CCM, which integrates a mesoporous silica-loaded iron oxyhydroxide (MSF) core camouflaged with a homologous membrane. This design conferred dual functionality: (1) enhanced tumor accumulation and immune evasion by exploiting homologous cell-cell interactions and mimicking \"self\" markers, thereby effectively bypassing macrophage clearance and surpassing the limitations of traditional targeted drug delivery; and (2) amplified ultrasound (US)-mediated intratumoral penetration. The MSF core, with its unique porous structure and rough surface, significantly enhanced US cavitation effects, transiently disrupting tumor vasculature and facilitating deep penetration of nanomedicines. Upon US triggering, MSF@CCM effectively disrupted intracellular redox homeostasis, potently inducing ferroptosis via lipid peroxidation accumulation, mitochondrial morphological changes, and decreased key protein expression. This combined therapeutic strategy achieved a remarkable 96.5% tumor growth inhibition in vivo while maintaining favorable biocompatibility. Our findings establish a novel paradigm for overcoming multidimensional bio-barriers through biohybrid engineering and physical energy synergy, offering a promising modality for enhanced cancer therapy.",

However, their transactivation mechanisms remain unclear, and effective targeting strategies are lacking. Here, we show that YAP/TAZ possess a hydrophobic transactivation domain (TAD). TAD knockout prevents tumor establishment due to growth defects and enhances immune attack. Mechanistically, TADs facilitate preinitiation complex (PIC) assembly by recruiting the TATA-binding protein-associated factor 4 (TAF4)-dependent TFIID complex and enhance RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation through mediator complex subunit 15 (MED15)-dependent mediator recruitment for the expressions of oncogenic/immune-suppressive programs. The synthesized peptide TJ-M11 selectively disrupts TAD interactions with MED15 and TAF4, suppressing tumor growth and sensitizing tumors to immunotherapy. Our findings demonstrate that YAP/TAZ TADs exhibit dual functions in PIC assembly and Pol II elongation via hydrophobic interactions, which represent actionable targets for cancer therapy and combination immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "The ability of cancer cells to evade immune destruction is governed by various intrinsic factors including their metabolic state. Here we demonstrate that inactivation of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), a pyrimidine synthesis enzyme, increases cancer cell sensitivity to T cell cytotoxicity through induction of ferroptosis. Lipidomic and metabolomic analyses reveal that DHODH inhibition reduces CDP-choline level and attenuates the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) via the CDP-choline-dependent Kennedy pathway. To compensate this loss, there is increased synthesis from phosphatidylethanolamine via the phospholipid methylation pathway resulting in increased generation of very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing PCs. Importantly, inactivation of Dhodh in cancer cells promotes the infiltration of interferon \u03b3-secreting CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and enhances the anti-tumor activity of PD-1 blockade in female mouse models. Our findings reveal the importance of DHODH in regulating immune evasion through a CDP-choline dependent mechanism and implicate DHODH as a promising target to improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies.",

The disease is divided into cutaneous mastocytosis, systemic mastocytosis (SM) and mast cell sarcoma. SM is further categorized into several non-advanced and advanced forms. The prognosis of cutaneous mastocytosis and non-advanced SM is mostly favourable, whereas prognosis and survival in advanced SM and mast cell sarcoma are poor. During the past 15 years, major advances have been made in the diagnosis, prognosis and management of patients with mast cell neoplasms. Management of mastocytosis consists of symptomatic therapy, including anti-mast cell mediator drugs, and cytoreductive agents for patients with advanced disease and selected individuals with non-advanced disease, as well as recognition and prevention of comorbidities such as osteoporosis and anaphylaxis. The preclinical and clinical development of KIT-D816V-targeting drugs, such as midostaurin or avapritinib, mark a milestone in improving management, the quality of life and survival in patients with SM. These agents induce major responses or even remission in people with advanced SM and lead to rapid improvement of mediator-related symptoms and quality of life in symptomatic patients.",

    "abstract": "High c-Myc protein accumulation contributes to the proliferation, invasion, and drug resistance in multiple cancer cells, but the underlying mechanism about c-Myc accumulation remains not to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that TTC36 promotes c-Myc protein accumulation in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, thereby driving the proliferation and sorafenib resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Ttc36 depletion disrupts the interaction between SET and PPP2R1A, consequently activating PP2A. Activated PP2A directly dephosphorylates p-c-Myc<sup>S62</sup> and activates GSK3\u03b2, relying on AKT, leading increased phosphorylation of p-c-Myc<sup>T58</sup>, finally promotes FBXW7-mediated polyubiquitination and degradation of c-Myc. Inhibitors targeting GSK3\u03b2 and PP2A effectively reverse the sorafenib resistance promoted by TTC36.

Oncolytic herpes virus (oHSV) initiates direct tumor debulking by tumor lysis and activates anti-tumor immunity, however, little is known about the role of glioma metabolism in determining oHSV efficacy. Here we identify that oHSV rewires central carbon metabolism increasing glucose utilization towards oxidative phosphorylation and shuttling glutamine towards reductive carboxylation in IDH wildtype glioma. The switch in metabolism results in increased lipid synthesis and cellular ROS. PKC induces ACSL4 in oHSV treated cells leading to lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is critical to launch an anti-tumor immune response which is important for viral efficacy. Mutant IDH (IDHR132H) gliomas are incapable of reductive carboxylation and hence ferroptosis. Pharmacological blockade of IDHR132H induces ferroptosis and anti-tumor immunity.

The ovarian-tumor related protease (OTU) is involved in regulating critical cell signaling pathways, but the functions of most OTUs have yet to be explored. In this study, an unbiased RNAi screening revealed that ovarian tumor domain-containing 2 (YOD1) knockdown significantly promoted cell metastasis. YOD1 downregulation promoted ccRCC growth and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, YOD1 knockdown stimulated the growth of organoids derived from ccRCC patients. Further investigation revealed that YOD1 directly interacted with and stabilized Zinc finger protein 24 (ZNF24) expression by deubiquitination in a manner dependent on its catalytic activity. YOD1 inhibition attenuated ZNF24 transcriptional repression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), thereby promoting VEGFA gene expression. Furthermore, ZNF24 was identified as a key mediator of YOD1 function. The expression of YOD1 and ZNF24 was significantly downregulated in tumor tissues, with a strong correlation between them. Importantly, reduced YOD1 and ZNF24 levels were strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes in ccRCC patients. Our results reveal the mechanism by which YOD1 regulates VEGFA transcription and suppresses tumorigenesis by deubiquitinating ZNF24, providing a therapeutic target in ccRCC.",

Despite aggressive therapeutic regimens, GBM treatment is still an unmet clinical need due to heterogeneity, recurrencies, and resistance. Metabolic reshaping is emerging as a critical mechanism supporting cell proliferation and sustaining chemoresistance. In this study, we explored metabolic changes induced by chemotherapy in temozolomide (TMZ)-sensitive and TMZ-resistant GBM cell lines. We found that purine levels were altered in sensitive versus resistant GBM cells, highlighting a critical role of guanosine and inosine metabolism. By using a mesenchymal-like GBM zebrafish model, we uncovered dysregulated pathways involved in purine metabolism, with a downregulation of catabolic processes. Our data indicate that combined treatment with TMZ plus guanosine and inosine increased cytotoxicity, enhancing chemotherapy effectiveness in TMZ-resistant cells. These effects correlated with alterations in mitochondrial dynamics and activity. Specifically, the combinatorial effectiveness of TMZ with guanosine and inosine was linked to Mitofusin-2 overexpression, enhancing mitochondrial fusion, typically associated with a better prognosis. Therefore, our findings suggest that purine metabolism is involved in the metabolic rewiring of TMZ-resistant cells, suggesting guanosine and inosine as potential adjuvant treatments to improve the cytotoxicity effects of chemotherapy in resistant GBM.",

The impact of clinical, pathological, and treatment strategies on the risk of early relapse has not been assessed in a large cohort of patients. We performed a pooled analysis of patients recruited in France from six randomized first-line MCL trials. Among 1386 treated MCL patients, 1280 were evaluable for POD24 status: 299 (23.4%) with a POD24 event and 981 (76.6%) without. Patients with a POD24 event had a median OS of 9.3 months (95% CI 8.4-11.8) versus not reached (95% CI 97.8-NR) for those without POD24 events. The median post-relapse OS of patients with a late relapse was also significantly longer at 49.4 months (HR\u2009=\u20090.39; 95% CI 0.31-0.48; P\u2009<\u20090.001) as compared to POD24 patients. Baseline variables (age, performance status, B symptoms, LDH/ULN, leukocytes, blastoid variant, and Ki-67\u2009>\u200930%) were significantly associated with the risk of POD24, independent of ASCT. Among responding patients at end-of-induction (n\u2009=\u20091105) who had received ASCT, anti-CD20 maintenance was associated with a decreased risk of POD24 (OR\u2009=\u20090.37; 95% CI 0.1-1.0). Using this large data set of patients in clinical trials, we confirm that POD24 status is strongly associated with subsequent OS in MCL. Rituximab maintenance provided significant protection against the risk of POD24, independent of ASCT. Progression within 2 years should be considered as a primary endpoint in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are effective in cells with homologous recombination (HR) deficiency, including BRCA1/2 mutation. However, PARP inhibitors remain a therapeutic challenge in breast and ovarian cancer due to inevitably acquired resistance in most cases. Therefore, strategies to overcome PARP inhibitor resistance are unmet clinical need. SRY-box transcription factor 5 (SOX5) plays a crucial role in development of various cancers but the role of SOX5 in PARP inhibitor resistance is poorly understood. This study identified SOX5 as a potential biomarker associated with PARP inhibitor resistance and addressed potential treatment strategies to overcome PARP inhibitor resistance using the olaparib-resistant preclinical model. We observed that SOX5 was significantly upregulated in olaparib-resistant cells and contributed to PARP inhibitor resistance by upregulating DNA repair pathway genes. Ectopic SOX5 overexpression contributed to PARP inhibitor resistance by suppressing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in BRCA-mutated breast and ovarian cancer. SOX5 small interfering RNA combined with olaparib sensitized olaparib-resistant cells and suppressed the growth of olaparib-resistant xenografts in mice via increased DSBs represented by \u0263H2AX formation. Mechanistically, SOX5 directly interacted with yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) and promoted its nuclear translocation by suppressing the Hippo pathway. YAP1, in association with TEA domain family members (TEAD), upregulated HR-related gene expression and conferred PARP inhibitor resistance. Furthermore, the clinical relevance of SOX5 as a therapeutic target was supported by a significant association between SOX5 overexpression and poor prognosis in ovarian cancer on public mRNA microarray data sets. Therefore, we propose SOX5 as a promising therapeutic target for overcoming PARP inhibitor resistance in BRCA1/2-mutated breast and ovarian cancer.",

This is a major problem of public health since it will become the second leading cause of death by cancer in the next few years, mainly due to the lack of efficient therapies. Transient Receptor Potential Cation Channel Subfamily M Member 7 (TRPM7) protein, a cation channel fused with a serine/threonine kinase domain is overexpressed in PDAC and associated with a low survival. In this work, we aim to study the role of kinase domain on pancreatic cell fates by using a model of kinase domain deletion by CRISPR-Cas9. PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 PDAC cell lines were used and kinase domain was deleted by CRISPR-Cas9 strategy. Kinase domain deletion (\u0394K) was validated by RT-qPCR and western blots. The effect of kinase domain deletion on channel function was studied by patch-clamp and Mn<sup>2+</sup>-quenching. The cell phenotype was studied by MTT and cell migration/invasion assays. Finally, the role of kinase domain was studied in vivo in xenografted mice. Here we show that TRPM7 kinase domain is required to maintain a mesenchymal phenotype in PDAC cells. We also demonstrated that TRPM7 and PAK1 interact in the same protein complexes. Moreover, TRPM7 kinase domain is required for carcinogenesis and cancer cell dissemination in vivo. Intriguingly, the role of TRPM7 kinase is cell specific and may depend on the KRAS oncogene mutation status. In conclusion, TRPM7 kinase domain is required to maintain a mesenchymal and aggressive phenotype in PDAC cells, and it could be a promising target against PDAC.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) has emerged as a predominant cause of cancer-related mortality among men globally. The mechanisms of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) contributing to the development of PCa remain inadequately elucidated. The objective of this study was to examine the involvement of BCAAs and BCAT2 in tumorigenesis. BCAAs exhibited elevated expression levels in PCa tissues and cells. Among the critical enzymes involved in the BCAA metabolic pathway, only BCAT2 demonstrated significant expression in PCa and was closely associated with tumor progression and patient prognosis. RNA sequencing along with related functional experiments indicated that BCAT2 can inhibit autophagy, autophagy-related apoptosis, and ferroptosis in PCa. Furthermore, the results of co-immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and other methodologies established that PCBP1, as a downstream protein interacting with BCAT2, co-regulates the PI3K/AKT pathway, thereby influencing progression of PCa. Moreover, BCAT2 interacted with PCBP1 at Leucine 239 to collaboratively regulate the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which is crucial for the initiation and progression of PCa. Targeting BCAT2 may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent proliferation of PCa.",

    "abstract": "The objective of the study is to conduct a systematic assessment of the clinical effectiveness differences between single-port and multi-port robotic surgical systems in the context of renal tumor removal, grounded in evidence-based medical data. Adhering to PRISMA standards, a comprehensive literature search was executed across PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from their inception until March 2025. The search included randomized controlled trials and cohort studies that compared single-port and multi-port robotic systems for partial or radical nephrectomy. Statistical analysis of the outcomes was carried out using Stata 15.0, with the results presented as weighted mean difference (WMD) and odds ratio (OR). Subgroup analyses were conducted to examine the consistency of the findings with respect to thermal ischemia duration. A combined analysis of 11 studies, comprising 1729 participants, were analyzed, with 654 individuals in the single-port cohort and 1075 in the multi-port cohort. The meta-analysis revealed a significantly shorter hospital stay for the single-port cohort compared to the multi-port cohort (WMD\u2009=\u2009-0.32, 95% CI -0.47, -0.17, p\u2009<\u20090.05). However, the single-port cohort also experienced a longer thermal ischemia time (WMD\u2009=\u20092.92, 95% CI 0.45, 5.38, p\u2009<\u20090.05). No statistically significant differences were found between the two cohorts regarding complication rates, intraoperative blood loss, operative time, positive margin rates, conversion rates, or tumor recurrence rates. Single-port robotic nephrectomy for renal tumors can enhance postoperative recovery without compromising oncologic safety. Nevertheless, its effect on renal function preservation requires careful evaluation. Future investigations ought to encompass extended, high-caliber studies to offer more substantial data for clinical choices.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a significant global health concern and ranks as the third leading cause of cancer-associated mortality. Systemic therapy faces the emergence of resistance, which hinders the clinical benefits. Recent evidence suggests that exosomes, measuring between 30 and 150\u00a0nm in size, which impact the antitumor immune responses, making them a promising candidate for cancer immunotherapy. Owing to their unique physical and chemical characteristics, exosomes can be tailored and engineered for a range of therapeutic objectives. In the present review, we outline the immunomodulatory functions of exosomes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of HCC, aiming to decipher the underlying mechanisms of exosomes in remodeling suppressive TME. Moreover, we provide detailed and intuitive resource for leveraging the potential of exosomes in immunotherapy, presenting valuable strategies to improve and optimize HCC treatment. Despite the huge therapeutic potential of exosomes, significant challenges persist, including the need for standardization in exosome production, optimization of cargo loading techniques, and the assurance of safety and effectiveness in clinical applications. Addressing these challenges may pave the way for exosome-based immunotherapy for HCC patients.",

The study aimed to compare the composition of immune cell infiltration from aspirates of different BM prior to systemic therapy. Phenotypic and functional analyses were conducted via multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC) on BM-derived aspirates obtained from patients with breast cancer (BC, n\u2009=\u20096), patients with prostate cancer (PC, n\u2009=\u20095), patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (n\u2009=\u20097), patients with myeloma (MM, n\u2009=\u200910) and bone aspirates from age-matched non-malignant controls (NMC, n\u2009=\u200910).

In addition, BM-derived M2-like macrophages exhibited an increased subset of cells co-expressing either TIGIT and PVRL4 or CD112 and CD155. Using a myeloma model, functional in vitro studies showed that blockade of TIGIT and CD39 leads to increased PBMC-mediated lysis of myeloma cells. The study shows that an altered immune cell composition is present in BM across the different tumor entities.

    "abstract": "Advances in high-throughput sequencing have increased the detection of TP53 variations, many of which occur at low allelic fractions. Such variants may arise due to clonal hematopoiesis (CHIP) or constitutional mosaicism, complicating their clinical classification and management. Since guidelines recommend Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS)-like management for individuals carrying TP53 variations, accurately determining the origin of low variant allelic fraction (VAF) variants is essential for risk assessment and clinical decision-making. This study evaluates TP53 VAF in patients with suspected hereditary cancer predisposition, tested via multigene panels and emphasizes the importance of conducting a detailed investigation before making clinical decisions in patients with low-VAF. In retrospectively analyzed 1,520 cases, we identified 17 actionable TP53 variations in 16 cases (1%). All cases were female (mean cancer onset age of 45.9\u00a0years) and classified as attenuated LFS. Eleven of the variants had an allelic fraction of\u2009\u2264\u200920%. Patients over 60\u00a0years showed significantly lower VAF than those under 40 (p\u2009=\u20090.03). The TP53 variant was detected in only one ancillary sample, and her tumor sample was monoallelic, confirming the germline origin. For an accurate classification and successful management of cases with TP53 variations, defining the origin of variants, especially for low VAF, is imperative.",

    "abstract": "Glycolysis, a classic characteristic of cancer cells, can drive cancer progression by generating lactate, which play as a key immunosuppressive mediator. Currently, ubiquitin-specific proteases 5 (USP5) has been demonstrated to facilitate tumor cell survival in multiple myeloma (MM), whereas whether USP5 was involved in glycolysis-lactate production pathway and immunosuppressive microenvironment formation in MM remain unknown. The gene and protein expression characteristics were assessed via qRT-PCR and western blot. MM cell survival was determined by CCK-8 and flow cytometry analysis. Glycolysis was evaluated by examining glucose uptake, lactate production and ATP level via corresponding kits. Tumor-associated macrophages polarization was tested via measurement of M1/M2-like macrophage markers using qRT-PCR and flow cytometry methods. Dual-luciferase reporter, chromatin immunoprecipitation and co-immunoprecipitation assays were conducted to verified molecular relationship. Xenograft model was used for verified cellular findings. USP5 was abnormally overexpressed in MM patients and cell lines. Knockdown of USP5 could restrain MM cell survival and glycolysis activity, thus reducing lactate-mediated immunosuppressive M2-like macrophage polarization in vitro and in vivo, whereas overexpression of USP5 play opposite impacts. Mechanistically, USP5 could downregulate the ubiquitination modification of STAT to stabilize STAT2 protein, thus activating PFKFB4 transcription. Moreover, STAT2 could overturn the regulatory role of USP5 on MM cell survival, glycolysis and lactate-mediated immunosuppressive M2-like macrophage polarization. These findings elucidated that USP5 served as a regulator of glycolysis-lactate to stimulate M2-like macrophage formation by regulating STAT2-PFKFB4 signaling, which supported that USP5 could be a viable therapeutic target of MM treatment.",

    "abstract": "Protective ileostomy is an important bridging procedure in low anterior resection for rectal cancer, aimed at preventing severe anastomotic complications. It has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of pelvic infections resulting from anastomotic leakage. However, whether ileostomy plays a positive clinical role in preventing anastomotic leaks remains a subject of considerable debate. The procedure for creating a protective ileostomy is relatively simple and convenient, making it a commonly used approach in clinical practice. Nevertheless, as a traumatic surgical procedure, ileostomy itself may lead to a range of complications. Therefore, it is crucial to comprehensively understand the potential complications associated with ileostomy, develop optimized management strategies, and carefully select appropriate patients for preventive ileostomy, as these steps hold significant clinical value. This article provides a systematic review of the types, development, and application of preventive ileostomy, as well as the management and prevention strategies for common complications.

    "title": "[Application of endoscopic intermuscular dissection in the treatment of rectal tumors].",
    "abstract": "Rectal tumors, as a common type of gastrointestinal tumor, can be treated through various methods, including endoscopic resection, surgical resection, and radiotherapy. With the in-depth research in the mechanisms of tumors development and the increasing patient demands for quality of life , endoscopic treatment has rapidly advanced due to its advantages of being minimally invasive, promoting faster recovery, and reducing costs. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), a well-established therapeutic technique, has been widely used for the treatment of precancerous lesions and early-stage tumors in the gastrointestinal tract, as well as for the resection of submucosal tumors such as rectal neuroendocrine tumor. However, ESD faces challenges when dealing with lesions accompanied by severe fibrosis or potential deep submucosal infiltration, leading to difficulties in dissection and the risk of positive vertical margins, which increases the risk of tumor recurrence. The emergence of endoscopic intermuscular dissection (EID) provides a novel approach to address these issues. By dissecting between the inner circular and outer longitudinal muscle layers of the muscularis propria, EID achieves the complete resection of the mucosa, submucosa, and inner circular muscle layer without compromising the integrity of the intestinal wall, thereby resolving the issue of positive vertical margins in histopathological evaluation. The clinical application of EID is still in its early stages. This article reviews the literature to summarize the development and clinical applications of EID technology, providing strategies insights for the minimally invasive endoscopic treatment of rectal tumors.",

The assistant lifts the proper mesentery of the digestive tract to be resected or the adjacent mesenteric tissue connected to it,thereby elevating the target organ and its mesentery as a whole away from the mesenteric bed. By utilizing the tension transmission between the proper mesenteries of adjacent organs to create counter-tension,the surgeon's operative actions are always maintained along the line of maximum counter-tension.After incising the mesenteric fusion line,this technique assists the surgeon in entering the fusion plane. A descriptive case series study method was adopted to retrospectively analyze the clinical and pathological data of 37 colorectal cancer patients who underwent laparoscopic left hemicolectomy with the \"Dual-Wing\" traction technique via a medial and cephalad approach, performed by the Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery at Dongjie Campus of the First Hospital of Quanzhou, Fujian Medical University, from May 2023 to November 2023. <b>Results:</b> All patients successfully underwent laparoscopic left hemicolectomy via the medial & head lateral approach using the \"Dual-Wing\" traction technique.The surgery adhered to the principles of total mesocolic excision and safely mobilized the left colon and its mesentery from the correct anatomical plane. In the entire group of patients,there were 14 males and 23 females; the mean operative time was 94.1\u00b118.3 minutes; the mean intraoperative blood loss was 9.8\u00b15.4 ml; the mean number of lymph nodes dissected was 18.1\u00b13.9; the mean number of positive lymph nodes was 1.4\u00b11.6; the pathological specimen resection margin grading was Grade A in 29 cases, Grade B in 8 cases, and no Grade C cases; the tumor TNM staging was Stage I in 3 cases, Stage IIA in 7 cases, Stage IIB in 6 cases, Stage IIIA in 2 cases, Stage IIIB in 15 cases, and Stage IIIC in 4 cases; the mean time to first flatus postoperatively was 35.7\u00b17.5 hours; the mean length of hospital stay was 9.1\u00b11.7 days. There were no intraoperative injuries to the pancreas or spleen. Postoperative complications occurred in 3 cases. No anastomotic leakage was observed in the entire group, and there were no deaths following the surgery. <b>Conclusion:</b> The application of the \"Dual-Wing\" traction technique to establish a stable surgical scenario can significantly reduce the demands on the assistant. It is conducive to maintaining mesenteric tension and fully exposing the surgical field. It also allows for the rapid identification and maintenance of the correct anatomical plane. For colorectal cancer patients, the surgery is safe and feasible, with satisfactory short-term therapeutic effects.",

Patients with distant metastases, other malignant tumors, combined organ resection, gastric stump cancer, positive margin, and incomplete clinical or follow-up data were excluded. X-tile software analysis of the actual overall survival of the collected cases yielded an optimal cut-off of 32 years. Accordingly, the enrolled cases were divided into an early-onset young group (age \u226432 years) and young adult group (age >32 years). Clinicopathological characteristics, long-term survival, and postoperative recurrence were compared between the two groups. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using the Cox proportional hazards model to identify the factors affecting the prognosis of young patients with gastric cancer. <b>Results:</b> The study cohort comprised 462 patients, including 256 (55.4%) women, 419 (90.7%) with middle and lower gastric cancers, and 343 (74.2%) with poorly differentiated tumors.

Further simple effects analysis of each of the assessed variables revealed that, one month after surgery, patients in the venous group had significantly less severe gastrointestinal symptoms (<i>M</i> [<i>Q</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>Q</i><sub>3</sub>]: 9 [7,13] vs. 11 [9,13], <i>Z</i>=2.416, <i>P</i>=0.016) and defecation dysfunction (<i>M</i> [<i>Q</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>Q</i><sub>3</sub>]: 13 [8,14] vs. 19 [16,22], <i>Z</i>=8.813, <i>P</i><0.001) compared with the arterial group; these differences are all statistically significant (all <i>P</i><0.05). Three months after surgery, the venous group showed significantly better defecation function than did the arterial group (<i>M</i> [<i>Q</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>Q</i><sub>3</sub>]:10 [6,13] vs. 11 [6,14], <i>Z</i>=2.591, <i>P</i><0.001); this difference is statistically significant (<i>P</i><0.05). However, 6 months after surgery, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in any of the assessed variables (all <i>P</i>>0.05).Generalized estimating equation analysis revealed statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of bowel frequency (<i>P</i>=0.027), stool consistency (<i>P</i>=0.046), urgency to defecate (<i>P</i>=0.008), and total score (<i>P</i><0.001) with regard to the group-by-time interaction (all <i>P</i><0.05). Further simple effects analysis of each of the assessed variables showed that 1 month after surgery, patients in the venous group had better outcomes than those in the arterial group in terms of bowel frequency (<i>M</i> [<i>Q</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>Q</i><sub>3</sub>]:0 [0,2] vs. 2 [1,3]) points, <i>Z</i>=3.479, <i>P</i><0.001), stool consistency (<i>M</i> [<i>Q</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>Q</i><sub>3</sub>]:0 [0,1] vs. 1 [0,2] points, <i>Z</i>=3.377, <i>P</i><0.001), urgency to defecate (<i>M</i> [<i>Q</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>Q</i><sub>3</sub>]:0 [0,2] vs. 2 [1,3] points, <i>Z</i>=2.798, <i>P</i>=0.005), and total score (<i>M</i> [<i>Q</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>Q</i><sub>3</sub>]:3 [2,5] vs. 5 [4,7] points, <i>Z</i>=5.318, <i>P</i><0.001); all of these differences are statistically significant (all <i>P</i><0.05). Three months after surgery, outcomes in patients in the venous group remained superior to those in the arterial group in terms of bowel frequency (<i>M</i> [<i>Q</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>Q</i><sub>3</sub>]: 1 [0,1] vs. 1 [0,2] points, <i>Z</i>=2.230, <i>P</i>=0.026), stool consistency (<i>M</i> [<i>Q</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>Q</i><sub>3</sub>]: 0 [0,1] vs. 1 [0,1] points, <i>Z</i>=2.699, <i>P</i>=0.007), and total score (<i>M</i> [<i>Q</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>Q</i><sub>3</sub>]:3 [2,4] vs. 3 [2,4] points, <i>Z</i>=2.530, <i>P</i>=0.011); all of these differences are statistically significant (all <i>P</i><0.05). However, 6 months after surgery, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in any of the four assessed variables or the total score. The median duration of follow-up was 41 (9-64) months. The 3-year overall survival rates were 93.3% and 95.8% in the venous and arterial groups, respectively; this difference is not statistically significant (<i>P</i>=0.403). However, the 3-year disease-free survival rate was 86.5% in the venous group, which is significantly lower than that in the arterial group (95.0%, <i>P</i>=0.027). <b>Conclusion:</b> Laparoscopic D3 lymph node dissection of the right colon using the left margin of the superior mesenteric artery as the medial boundary for lymph node dissection is safe and necessary, which can improve the disease-free survival time of patients. This surgical procedure affects the patient's quality of life in the short term,but gradually improves six months after surgery.",

    "abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> To analyze the types and characteristics of post-operative complications in colorectal cancer patients aged over 85 years undergoing laparoscopic surgery, and to summarize peri-operative management strategies. <b>Methods:</b> This was an observational study. Inclusion criteria: pathologically confirmed adenocarcinoma; tumor located in ileocecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, or rectum; undergoing laparoscopic radical resection for colorectal cancer; complete clinical data. Exclusion criteria included distant metastasis, synchronous resection of multiple primary cancers, simultaneous liver metastasis surgery, and follow-up duration <1 month. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 191 patients of colorectal cancer patients aged over 85 years who underwent laparoscopic radical surgery in the General Surgery Department at Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January 2019 to January 2024. Among 191 patients, 107 patients (56.0%) had colon cancer and 84 (44.0%) rectal cancer. All patients received \"home-based prehabilitation\" and post-operative \"enhanced recovery after surgery\" protocols. Patient characteristics, peri-operative complication types, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> Post-operative complications occurred in 97 patients (50.8%), including 53 colon cancer patients (54.6%) and 44 rectal cancer patients (45.4%). Comorbidities existed in 88 patients (90.7%), with 93 patients (95.9%) classified as ASA II-III pre-operatively and 86 (88.7%) having nutritional risks. Surgical procedures included Dixon procedure (38 patients, 39.2%), right hemicolectomy (33 patients, 34.0%), sigmoidectomy (10 patients, 10.3%), and 17 patients (17.5%) received prophylactic stomas. Complication types comprised non-anastomotic infections (38 patients, 19.9%), intestinal flora disorder (26 patients, 13.6%), anastomotic/wound/stoma-related complications (16 patients, 8.4%), thrombotic/hemorrhagic events (6 patients, 3.1%), and others (11 patients, 5.8%). By Clavien-Dindo classification: Grade I (12 patients, 6.3%), Grade II (69 patients, 36.1%), Grade III (12 patients, 6.3%), and Grade IV (4 patients, 2.1%). Except for 5 patients (2.6%) requiring unplanned re-operation, all complications resolved with conservative treatment. The median duration of post-operative hospitalization was 9.5 days (7-13). <b>Conclusion:</b> Non-anastomotic infections and intestinal flora disorder constitute predominant complications after laparoscopic surgery in colorectal cancer patients aged over 85 years, mostly manageable with conservative treatment. Strengthened peri-operative management incorporating pre-operative prehabilitation and post-operative enhanced recovery after surgery protocols is crucial for patients aged over 85 years.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of surgical techniques and the deepening of minimally invasive concepts, single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) and robot-assisted surgery (RAS) are gaining increasing attention in the field of colorectal cancer treatment as representatives of modern surgery's move towards more minimally invasive and precise approaches. While these technologies offer advantages such as reduced trauma, less pain, and faster recovery, they also introduce unique challenges. The high technical demands of SILS, along with the lack of force feedback in robotic systems, can easily lead to unexpected injuries of blood vessels, tissues, or organs. Inappropriate handling can increase the complexity of the surgery and affect clinical outcomes. Timely identification and swift, correct responses can prevent severe consequences for patients. Based on over a decade of experience by our team in treating colorectal cancer with SILS and RAS, and incorporating the latest research advancements both domestically and internationally, this article discusses common intraoperative incidents, management strategies, and preventive measures associated with SILS and RAS. It aims to provide valuable references for surgeons performing these procedures, enhancing their capability to manage intraoperative challenges effectively.",

    "title": "[Laparoscopic and robotic ultralow sphincter-saving operation and intersphincteric resection for rectal cancer:prevention and management for major complications].",
    "abstract": "In laparoscopic and robot-assisted ultra-low sphincter-saving surgeries for rectal cancer, preserving sexual function, preventing anastomotic leakage, anastomotic stricture, and low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) is critical to ensuring a good postoperative quality of life. The primary strategy for preventing postoperative sexual dysfunction is the meticulous preservation of the autonomic nerves, particularly the neurovascular bundles in the prostate area, guided by precise anatomical dissection. Partial preservation of the Denonvilliers fascia during total mesorectal excision (TME) not only helps protect the anterior mesorectum but also safeguards the neurovascular bundles. To prevent anastomotic leakage, it is essential to achieve clear oncologic margins, ensure a robust blood supply to both the proximal and distal margins, maintain a tension-free anastomosis, and avoid thermal or radiation injury whenever possible. In elderly patients with metabolic diseases, persistent descending mesocolon, or those undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, selective preservation of the left colic artery may be considered. Additionally, reinforcing the anastomosis with sutures at the 'dog-ear' site, closing the pelvic peritoneum, and placing a transanal tube for drainage are beneficial strategies. Early identification of anastomotic leakage and timely intervention to ensure drainage can prevent delayed leakage, strictures, and the structural sequelae of anastomotic failure. To minimize fecal dysfunction, selective exemption from radiotherapy may be beneficial for mid-to-high rectal cancer, while for low rectal cancer, reconstruction of J-pouch reservoirs, end-to-side anastomosis, and transverse coloplasty can help reduce the incidence of severe low anterior resection syndrome. Additionally, for low rectal cancer following neoadjuvant therapy, a selective rectum-preserving strategy that avoids major surgery can effectively prevent these complications.",

    "abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> We aimed to analyze the spatio-temporal trend of breast cancer incidence and mortality in Shandong Province from 2012 to 2023 and predict the development trend from 2024 to 2030. <b>Methods:</b> Data on the incidence and mortality of breast cancer in Shandong Province from 2012 to 2023 were obtained from the Shandong Cancer Registry. The incidence, age-specific incidence, mortality, and age-specific mortality in different years, as well as in urban and rural areas, were calculated, and the rates were standardized based on the age composition of the Chinese standard population in 2000. The average annual percent change (AAPC) rate was calculated using Joinpoint 4.8.0.1 software. The global and local spatial autocorrelation analysis were performed using GeoDa 1.12 software. The Bayesian age-period-cohort model was used to predict the trend of breast cancer incidence and mortality from 2024 to 2030. <b>Results:</b> From 2012 to 2023, the breast cancer age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) showed an increasing trend. The ASIR increased from 30.48/100 000 in 2012 to 39.94/100 000 in 2023 (AAPC=2.59%, <i>P</i><0.001). The ASIR of urban and rural females also showed an upward trend. Additionally, the ASIR in rural areas (AAPC=3.33%, <i>P</i><0.001) increased more than that in urban areas (AAPC=1.83%, <i>P</i>=0.002). The incidence peak of breast cancer mainly concentrated in population aged 45-64 years, and with the increase of years, the incidence peak gradually moved forward. The age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) showed a downward trend. The ASMR decreased from 6.89/100 000 in 2012 to 4.93/100 000 in 2023 (AAPC=-3.12%, <i>P</i><0.001). The ASMR of urban and rural females also showed a downward trend (urban: AAPC=-3.56%, <i>P</i>=0.007; rural: AAPC=-2.72%, <i>P</i><0.001). The spatial analysis showed that from 2015 to 2023, the clustering areas of breast cancer incidence and mortality in Shandong had changed significantly. In 2015, the \"High-high clusters\" of ASIR mainly included Wendeng District in Weihai City, Dongying District, Kenli District, Lijin County, Guangrao County in Dongying City, Tianqiao District, Shizhong District in Jinan City; In 2023, the \"High-high clusters\" mainly included Jiaxiang County, Liangshan County, Jinxiang County, Wenshang County, Rencheng District in Jining City, Hedong District in Linyi City, Guangrao County in Dongying City. In 2015, the \"High-high clusters\" of ASMR only included Wenshang County in Jining City. In 2023, the \"High-high clusters\" mainly included Laizhou County in Yantai City, Junan County and Yishui County in Linyi City, Gaotang County in Liaocheng City, Dongping County and Ningyang County in Taian City. The Bayesian age-period-cohort model predicted that the ASIR trend of breast cancer in Shandong tended to be smooth (AAPC=0.33%, <i>P</i>=0.001). However, the ASMR remained decreasing (AAPC=-4.68%, <i>P</i><0.001). <b>Conclusions:</b> The breast cancer incidence in Shandong showed an increasing trend, and it is expected to be smooth by 2030. However, the mortality showed a continuous downward trend. The incidence peak was mainly in the population aged 45-64 years, with obvious regional differences. Targeted prevention and control measures should be taken for high-risk groups and areas in Shandong Province.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (referred to as liver cancer) tumor microenvironment (TMEs) is a dynamic network system composed of stromal cells, such as liver cancer cells, immune cells, vascular endothelial cells, adipocytes, fibroblasts, and various cytokines that play an important role in the invasion and metastasis of liver cancer. In recent years, there has been an increasing attention on the role of exosomes in the remodeling and the regulation of invasion and metastasis in liver cancer TMEs. Exosomes, as a natural carrier, mediate intercellular communication between liver cancer cells and with other stromal cells, playing an important role in the formation of immunosuppressive TMEs, angiogenesis and hypoxia tolerance, and the coordination of heterogeneity among liver cancer cells. This review summarizes the composition of liver cancer TMEs, the biological functions of exosomes, and the role and mechanism of exosome-mediated liver cancer TMEs between liver cancer cells and other stromal cells, with a focus on exosome involvement in the remodeling and regulating invasion and metastasis in liver cancer TMEs. Simultaneously, it also introduces and explores the application of exosomes in the diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer, with the hope that in-depth research and elucidation of the mechanisms of exosome involvement in the remodeling and regulation of invasion and metastasis in liver cancer TMEs will provide feasible research ideas for novel biological markers and drug delivery carriers.",

    "abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the expression, prognosis, and role of G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein 1 (GIT1) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor micro environments. <b>Methods:</b> Clinical data of 140 cases who underwent complete HCC surgical resection from January 2015 to December 2021 in Subei People's Hospital affiliated to Yangzhou University, Jiangsu Province, were included. Tumor tissue and adjacent tissue samples were collected for immunohistochemical analysis. The patients were divided into a high expression group and a low expression group according to the expression of GIT1. Cox regression was used to analyze the risk factors for prognosis in patients with HCC. Fifteen pairs of cancer tissues and adjacent tissues were randomly matched for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blot (WB), and immunohistochemical analysis. GITI knockout or overexpression cell lines of human hepatoma cell lines HepG2, HuH7 and MHCC97-H, and mouse hepatoma cell line Hepa 1-6 were constructed. The effects on M2 macrophage polarization were analyzed by flow cytometry. A mice tumor model was constructed. The growth curve of tumor tissue overexpressing GIT1 was plotted. Bioinformatics analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data was performed using OncoLnc, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, UALCAN, and GEPIA databases to explore the differential expression of GIT1 in HCC patients and its effect on prognosis. <b>Results:</b> Bioinformatics analysis showed that the expression level of GIT1 was significantly higher in HCC tissues than in normal liver tissues (<i>P</i><0.05). RT-PCR and WB experiments showed that GIT1 was highly expressed in HCC. The follow-up results showed that high expression of GIT1 was associated with poor prognosis in patients with HCC. The high expression of GIT1 was an independent risk factor for the prognosis in patients with HCC (<i>HR</i>=2.562, 95%<i>CI</i>: 0.231-0.704, <i>P</i><0.05). Functional enrichment analysis combined with TIMER database analysis found that GIT1 expression level was associated with multiple immune cell infiltrations in HCC, but the correlation coefficient with macrophage infiltration was the highest (<i>r</i>=0.545, <i>P</i><0.001). Mice tumorigenesis experiments showed that the tumor volume of GIT1-overexpressing mice was significantly increased (<i>P</i><0.05).

The MRI features and clinicopathological features of proliferative and non-proliferative type HCC were evaluated. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent predictive factors of proliferative-type HCC. The nomogram prediction model was constructed using R software. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to evaluate its diagnostic efficacy.

    "abstract": "Recent data suggest that vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor (VEGFRi) can enhance the anti-tumor activity of the anti-programmed cell death-1 (anti-PD-1) antibody in colorectal cancer (CRC) with microsatellite stability (MSS). However, the comparison between this combination and standard third-line VEGFRi treatment is not performed, and reliable biomarkers are still lacking. We retrospectively enrolled MSS CRC patients receiving anti-PD-1 antibody plus VEGFRi (combination group, <i>n</i>=54) or VEGFRi alone (VEGFRi group, <i>n</i>=32), and their efficacy and safety were evaluated. We additionally examined the immune characteristics of the MSS CRC tumor microenvironment (TME) through single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data, and an MSS CRC immune cell-related signature (MCICRS) that can be used to predict the clinical outcomes of MSS CRC patients receiving immunotherapy was developed and validated in our in-house cohort. Compared with VEGFRi alone, the combination of anti-PD-1 antibody and VEGFRi exhibited a prolonged survival benefit (median progression-free survival: 4.4 vs. 2.0 months, <i>P</i>=0.0024; median overall survival: 10.2 vs. 5.2 months, <i>P</i>=0.0038) and a similar adverse event incidence. Through single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analysis, we determined ten MSS CRC-enriched immune cell types and their spatial distribution, including naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T, regulatory CD4<sup>+</sup> T, CD4<sup>+</sup> Th17, exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T, cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T, proliferated CD8<sup>+</sup> T, natural killer (NK) cells, plasma, and classical and intermediate monocytes. Based on a systemic meta-analysis and ten machine learning algorithms, we obtained MCICRS, an independent risk factor for the prognosis of MSS CRC patients. Further analyses demonstrated that the low-MCICRS group presented a higher immune cell infiltration and immune-related pathway activation, and hence a significant relation with the superior efficacy of pan-cancer immunotherapy. More importantly, the predictive value of MCICRS in MSS CRC patients receiving immunotherapy was also validated with an in-house cohort. Anti-PD-1 antibody combined with VEGFRi presented an improved clinical benefit in MSS CRC with manageable toxicity. MCICRS could serve as a robust and promising tool to predict clinical outcomes for individual MSS CRC patients receiving immunotherapy.",

    "title": "Esculetin triggers ferroptosis via inhibition of the Nrf2-xCT/GPx4 axis in hepatocellular carcinoma.",
    "abstract": "Esculetin, a natural dihydroxy coumarin derived from the Chinese herbal medicine Cortex Fraxini, has demonstrated significant pharmacological activities, including anticancer properties. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, has garnered considerable attention due to its lethal effect on tumor cells. However, the exact role of ferroptosis in esculetin-mediated anti-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) effects remains poorly understood. This study investigated the impact of esculetin on HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. The findings indicate that esculetin effectively inhibited the growth of HCC cells. Importantly, esculetin promoted the accumulation of intracellular Fe<sup>2+</sup>, leading to an increase in ROS production through the Fenton reaction. This event subsequently induced lipid peroxidation (LPO) and triggered ferroptosis within the HCC cells. The occurrence of ferroptosis was confirmed by the elevation of malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, the depletion of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, and the disruption of mitochondrial morphology. Notably, the inhibitor of ferroptosis, ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), attenuated the anti-tumor effect of esculetin in HCC cells. Furthermore, the findings revealed that esculetin inhibited the Nrf2-xCT/GPx4 axis signaling in HCC cells. Overexpression of Nrf2 upregulated the expression of downstream SLC7A11 and GPX4, consequently alleviating esculetin-induced ferroptosis. In conclusion, this study suggests that esculetin exerts an anti-HCC effect by inhibiting the activity of the Nrf2-xCT/GPx4 axis, thereby triggering ferroptosis in HCC cells. These findings may contribute to the potential clinical use of esculetin as a candidate for HCC treatment.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer poses a significant threat to women's health, necessitating effective therapeutic strategies. Emd-D, an emodin derivative, demonstrates enhanced pharmaceutical properties and bioavailability. In this study, Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK8) assays and Ki-67 staining revealed dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation by Emd-D. Migration and invasion experiments confirmed its inhibitory effects on OVHM cells, while flow cytometry analysis demonstrated Emd-D-induced apoptosis. Mechanistic investigations elucidated that Emd-D functions as an inhibitor by directly binding to the glycolysis-related enzyme PFKFB4. This was corroborated by alterations in intracellular lactate and pyruvate levels, as well as glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and hexokinase 2 (HK2) expression. PFKFB4 overexpression experiments further supported the dependence of Emd-D on PFKFB4-mediated glycolysis and SRC3/mTORC1 pathway-associated apoptosis. In vivo experiments exhibited reduced xenograft tumor sizes upon Emd-D treatment, accompanied by suppressed glycolysis and increased expression of Bax/Bcl-2 apoptotic proteins within the tumors. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate Emd-D's potential as an anti-ovarian cancer agent through inhibition of the PFKFB4-dependent glycolysis pathway and induction of apoptosis. These results provide a foundation for further exploration of Emd-D as a promising drug candidate for ovarian cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a multifunctional cytokine integral to the differentiation, proliferation, and activation of various immune cells, especially those of myeloid lineage. Recombinant human GM-CSF (rhGM-CSF) plays a critical role after high-dose chemotherapy, hematopoietic cell transplantation, and high-dose irradiation by accelerating myeloid recovery and reducing the risk of severe infections. As an adjuvant in anti-tumor vaccines, rhGM-CSF stimulates the differentiation and activation of dendritic cells and promotes their recruitment to tumor sites. Despite the therapeutic benefits, rhGM-CSF can induce the production of anti-GM-CSF-autoantibodies (GM-CSF-Ab) that have been implicated in rare diseases, such as autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. These antibodies can neutralize GM-CSF activity, impairing macrophages and neutrophils. Furthermore, anti-GM-CSF-Ab have been linked to myeloid leukemias, where they are associated with active disease. The mechanisms behind anti-GM-CSF-Ab production and their role in disease progression remain poorly understood. This review article provides an overview of GM-CSF and anti-GM-CSF-Ab.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring D-amino acids concentrations has essential implications for gastric cancer diagnosis and treatment, especially in the non-invasive detection of gastric cancer. However, it remains a challenge to establish a high-performance detection method for D-amino acids. Here, a highly sensitive and selective d-alanine (D-Ala) ECL assay strategy via a turn-off-on split-type electrochemiluminescence (ECL) platform has been proposed. We found that hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) could be used as an efficient etching agent to turn on the MnO<sub>2</sub>/gold nanocluster (AuNC)-based ECL nanoswitch platform. Based on abovementioned characteristics, we extended it to the D-amino acids assay since the enzymatic reaction between D-Ala and D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) generates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Based on the abovementioned characteristics, this ECL sensing platform achieved a preferable linear-dependent curve in the detection range of 1.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 <sup>-</sup><sup>10</sup>\u223c1.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-</sup><sup>3</sup>\u00a0mol\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>, and realized the detection of D-Ala as low as 2.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-</sup><sup>11</sup>\u00a0mol\u00a0L<sup>-1</sup>\u00a0(S/N\u00a0=\u00a03). Furthermore, the proposed ECL biosensor showed excellent selectivity, stability, and reproducibility. Together with its powerful performance, this strategy could test D-Ala in saliva samples, which suggested that this ECL assay platform shows great prospect in disease diagnosis. We ascribe the high sensitivity and good anti-interference capability of the sensor to the combination of specific enzyme catalysis reaction, high-efficiency split-type AuNC probe-based ECL technique and the highly etching efficiency of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to MnO<sub>2</sub> nanomaterials on electrode surface. In our perception, this H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> mediated split-type ECL sensing platform provides a viable tool in ECL based bioananlysis. Therefore, our proposed approach not only provides a strategy for developing a high-performance platform for D-Ala detection, but also establishes a framework for the detailed design and development of ECL platform for other biological assays.",

    "abstract": "More than 80\u202f% of patients with melanoma are diagnosed without nodal metastasis, but most of those who relapse or die from melanoma are initially diagnosed as low risk early-stage. Here we investigate the ability of the Merlin Assay to stratify patients who did not undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for their risk of recurrence. 930 patients with clinical stage I/II primary cutaneous melanoma from the University of Tuebingen diagnosed between 2000 and 2020 were analyzed. None of the patients included underwent SLNB. The Merlin Assay combines patient age at diagnosis, Breslow thickness, and gene expression of eight specific genes from the primary tumor. Risk output labels are High Risk and Low Risk. Clinicopathological gene expression profile (CP-GEP) identified 879 patients as Low Risk and 51 patients as High Risk. The 10-year RFS (HR 20.07; p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and DMFS (HR 19.39; p\u202f<\u202f0.001) were significantly higher in CP-GEP Low Risk versus High Risk patients. Similar results were observed in 10-year MSS (HR 35.85; p\u202f<\u202f0.001). CP-GEP analysis of lentigo maligna melanoma and acral lentiginous melanoma showed that the performance of assay was independent of melanoma histological subtypes. This study shows that CP-GEP has the potential to stratify patients with early-stage melanoma who did not undergo SLNB based on their risk of recurrence. Patients with CP-GEP Low Risk have a significantly better long-term survival. CP-GEP shows to be promising for guiding SLNB referral and may support melanoma care by optimizing personalized treatment plans and potential surveillance regimens.",

    "abstract": "The OXEL study (NCT03487666) was a phase II trial of patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) with residual disease following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, randomized to receive immunotherapy (anti-programmed cell death protein 1, nivolumab), chemotherapy (capecitabine), or chemoimmunotherapy. We previously reported on the primary endpoint of the OXEL trial, demonstrating that a peripheral immunoscore based on circulating immune cells reflecting immune activation was increased in patients treated with immunotherapy. However, compared with cell-based immune assays, sera assays are more cost-effective, less labor-intensive, and samples easier to obtain. Here, we report on differences in serum analytes between treatment arms and associations with clinical response. Patients (n=38) were assayed for 97 serum analytes before and after 6 and 12 weeks of therapy. Serum analytes were assessed for changes with therapy, and as predictors of disease recurrence and the duration of invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) in both single analyte analyses and machine learning models. Levels of specific analytes at baseline and changes in levels at early time points on treatment preceding recurrence were associated with eventual development of disease recurrence and/or the duration of iDFS. These associations varied based on the therapy patients received. Immunotherapy led to enrichment in pro-inflammatory analytes following treatment, whereas chemotherapy resulted in overall decreases. Changes seen in patients receiving chemoimmunotherapy more closely resembled those observed in patients receiving immunotherapy alone as opposed to chemotherapy alone. Furthermore, logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models, developed using machine learning methods, demonstrated that combinations of serum analytes were more predictive of disease recurrence and iDFS duration than analyses of single serum analytes. Notably, the multivariable models that predicted patient outcomes were highly specific to the class of treatment patients received. In patients with TNBC with residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, treatment with immunotherapy alone or chemoimmunotherapy resulted in enhanced immune activation compared with chemotherapy alone as measured by changes in serum analyte levels. Distinct serum analytes, both at baseline and as changes after therapy, predicted clinical outcomes for patients receiving immunotherapy alone, chemotherapy alone, or chemoimmunotherapy.

    "title": "CLN-619, a MICA/B monoclonal antibody that promotes innate immune cell-mediated antitumor activity.",
    "abstract": "Major histocompatibility complex class I-related protein A and B (MICA/B) are ligands for the natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) receptor and are broadly expressed on tumor cells but minimally on normal tissues. When cytotoxic NKG2D-expressing immune cells engage MICA/B, the ligand-expressing cells are targeted for lysis. Cancer cells can evade NKG2D-mediated destruction by shedding MICA/B from their cell surface via proteases present in the tumor microenvironment. CLN-619 is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) which binds MICA/B and inhibits shedding resulting in accumulation of MICA/B on the tumor cell surface. CLN-619 may thereby have therapeutic effects in a broad range of malignancies by re-establishing the MICA/B-NKG2D axis to enable NKG2D-mediated, as well as Fc-gamma receptor-mediated, tumor cell lysis. CLN-619 was characterized for binding epitope and affinity, effects on surface and soluble levels of MICA/B, and in vitro tumor cell killing. In mouse models, the mAb was tested for tumor growth inhibition. The contribution of the Fc-gamma (Fc\u03b3) 1 domain to CLN-619 activity was also assessed. CLN-619 bound with high affinity to the alpha-3 domain of MICA/B without encumbering the interaction with NKG2D on natural killer cells. CLN-619 increased the level of cell surface expression of MICA/B and concomitantly decreased the levels of soluble MICA/B in cell culture assays. Treatment of cancer cell lines with CLN-619 induced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. CLN-619 resulted in potent inhibition of tumor growth in multiple xenograft models and increased survival of mice in a disseminated cancer model. CLN-619 inhibited the shedding of MICA/B to effectively restore cytotoxic signaling pathways in immune cells. Potent antitumor activity of CLN-619 as a monotherapy was observed in several preclinical models. Activity of CLN-619 required a functional Fc\u03b31 domain, suggesting the requirement of simultaneous engagement of NKG2D and cluster of differentiation 16A (CD16A) on immune cells for optimal cytotoxicity. The preclinical data reported here support the assessment of CLN-619 in patients with cancer.",

    "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP9, play a significant role in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression, mainly by extracellular matrix remodeling. However, little is known about MMP9 role in aberrant crypt foci (ACF) cluster formation, the earliest colon preneoplastic lesions. We conducted a bioinformatics analysis of MMPs expression in CRC using Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis2 (GEPIA2). Subsequently, we investigated MMP9 expression during the early stage of colon carcinogenesis in mice and assessed the effect of doxycycline (DOX), a global inhibitor of MMPs, on ACF cluster formation. Thus, NMRI mice received two weekly injections of 1,2-Dimethylhydrazine (DMH, 20\u2009mg/kg, subcutaneously), followed or not by DOX (100\u2009mg/kg, orally, from the 4th to the 6th week). GEPIA2 analysis indicated that among the 28 identified MMPs with collagenase and doxycycline-sensitive activities, MMPs 1, 3, 7, 9, and 13 were overexpressed in CRC tissues. Moreover, only MMP1 and MMP9 correlated well with collagen expression in colorectal tumors. In vivo, methylene blue-stained DMH-treated colons revealed multiple ACF clusters at week 6, associated with mucosa remodeling and sustained nitrosative stress as attested by enhanced collagen fibers, malondialdehyde level, and nitrotyrosine deposits. Pyrosequencing showed increased methylation at the tenth CpG site of the MMP9 promoter, which was associated with increased MMP9 expression. Interestingly, DOX attenuated the number and size of ACF clusters and mucosa remodeling without rebalancing nitrosative stress. Overexpression of MMP9 occurs early during colorectal carcinogenesis, and doxycycline may control the pathological remodeling of colon mucosa into ACF clusters by attenuating MMP9 activity.",

Our approach combines mathematical modeling of fluid-structure interactions in a simulated microfluidic channel with machine learning techniques. Specifically, we developed a cell-based modeling framework to assess CTC dynamics in erythrocyte-laden plasma flow, generating a large dataset of CTC trajectories that account for two distinct CTC phenotypes. Convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) were then employed to analyze the dataset and classify these phenotypes. The results demonstrate the potential effectiveness of the hyperuniform micropost MD design and analysis approach in distinguishing between different CTC phenotypes based on cell trajectory, offering a promising avenue for early cancer detection.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of adrenal incidentalomas is increasing annually, and most types of adrenal masses require surgical intervention. Accurate classification of common adrenal masses based on tumor computed tomography (CT) images by radiologists or clinicians requires extensive experience and is often challenging, which increases the workload of radiologists and leads to unnecessary adrenal surgeries. There is an urgent need for a fully automated, noninvasive, and precise approach for the identification and accurate classification of common adrenal masses. This study aims to enhance diagnostic efficiency and transform the current clinical practice of preoperative diagnosis of adrenal masses. This study is a retrospective analysis that includes patients with adrenal masses who underwent adrenalectomy from January 1, 2021, to May 31, 2023, at Center 1 (internal dataset), and from January 1, 2016, to May 31, 2023, at Center 2 (external dataset). The images include unenhanced, arterial, and venous phases, with 21,649 images used for the training set, 2406 images used for the validation set, and 12,857 images used for the external test set. We invited 3 experienced radiologists to precisely annotate the images, and these annotations served as references. We developed a deep learning-based adrenal mass detection model, Multi-Attention YOLO (MA-YOLO), which can automatically localize and classify 6 common types of adrenal masses. In order to scientifically evaluate the model performance, we used a variety of evaluation metrics, in addition, we compared the improvement in diagnostic efficacy of 6 doctors after incorporating model assistance. A total of 516 patients were included. In the external test set, the MA-YOLO model achieved an intersection over union of 0.838, 0.885, and 0.890 for the localization of 6 types of adrenal masses in unenhanced, arterial, and venous phase CT images, respectively. The corresponding mean average precision for classification was 0.885, 0.913, and 0.915, respectively. Additionally, with the assistance of this model, the classification diagnostic performance of 6 radiologists and clinicians for adrenal masses improved. Except for adrenal cysts, at least 1 physician significantly improved diagnostic performance for the other 5 types of tumors. Notably, in the categories of adrenal adenoma (for senior clinician: P=.04, junior radiologist: P=.01, and senior radiologist: P=.01) and adrenal cortical carcinoma (junior clinician: P=.02, junior radiologist: P=.01, and intermediate radiologist: P=.001), half of the physicians showed significant improvements after using the model for assistance. The MA-YOLO model demonstrates the ability to achieve efficient, accurate, and noninvasive preoperative localization and classification of common adrenal masses in CT examinations, showing promising potential for future applications.",

    "abstract": "In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), clinical and research investments for oncology screening, diagnosis, and therapy are exceedingly modest, compared to those in higher-income regions. Diseases that are difficult to prevent or treat, such as primary brain and central nervous system (CNS) tumors, are especially challenging in low-resource settings. In order to review and synthesize existing evidence to identify research and service gaps, we will conduct a scoping review to assess epidemiological data, clinical series, and health outcomes associated with brain and CNS tumors in SSA. This scoping review is guided by the Scoping Review Chapter of the JBI (Joanna Briggs Institute) Manual for Evidence Synthesis. We will search the following databases: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, references from salient publications, and the gray literature, the latter focused on the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and other major global health organizations. We will review titles and abstracts of potentially eligible studies and then full texts by 2 independent reviewers. We will include data from both primary and CNS cancers in persons of all ages. Data will be abstracted independently using piloted data extraction forms, and we will present results according to the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) and PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses Protocols) guidelines. A total of 2857 articles were identified through our search strategy. After title and abstract screening, which was completed on February 23, 2025, by 2 independent reviewers, 222 studies met the eligibility criteria, while 2203 were excluded. Full-text screening began on March 3, 2025, and will be followed by data abstraction and analysis from April 15, 2025, until the end of May 2025. The study is expected to be completed by July 2025. SSA faces substantial challenges in the diagnosis and treatment of CNS tumors due to health care infrastructure limitations, insufficient reporting, and diagnostic supply shortages. The high fatality rates are attributed to underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis as infectious diseases, despite low incidence rates (IRs). The inadequate neurosurgery facilities and pathology resources further complicate the treatment and prognosis. A scoping review will investigate the true burden of underdiagnosis and gaps in outcomes in children and adults in SSA. OSF Registries osf.io/57zvc; https://osf.io/57zvc. PRR1-10.2196/66978.",

    "title": "PathSynergy: a deep learning model for predicting drug synergy in liver cancer.",
    "abstract": "Cancer is a major public health problem while liver cancer is the main cause of global cancer-related deaths. The previous study demonstrates that the 5-year survival rate for advanced liver cancer is only 30%. Few of the first-line targeted drugs including sorafenib and lenvatinib are available, which often develop resistance. Drug combination therapy is crucial for improving the efficacy of cancer therapy and overcoming resistance. However, traditional methods for discovering drug synergy are costly and time consuming. In this study, we developed a novel predicting model PathSynergy by integrating drug feature data, cell line data, drug-target interactions, and signaling pathways. PathSynergy combined the advantages of graph neural networks and pathway map mapping. Comparing with other baseline models, PathSynergy showed better performance in model classification, accuracy, and precision. Excitingly, six Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs including pimecrolimus, topiramate, nandrolone_decanoate, fluticasone propionate, zanubrutinib, and levonorgestrel were predicted and validated to show synergistic effects with sorafenib or lenvatinib against liver cancer for the first time. In general, the PathSynergy model provides a new perspective to discover synergistic combinations of drugs and has broad application potential in the fields of drug discovery and personalized medicine.",

Treatment initiation follows the Rai and Binet staging systems, but the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia criteria emphasize active disease rather than stage alone. Early treatment in asymptomatic, high-risk patients has not shown an overall survival benefit, even with targeted therapies such as Bruton's tyrosine kinase and BCL2 inhibitors.

    "title": "Which Is the Best Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor for Newly Diagnosed Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia?",
    "abstract": "The choice of frontline therapy for a patient with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CP-CML) can have a profound effect on the long-term clinical outcome. Currently, five tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs-imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, and asciminib) are available for frontline therapy, but no single TKI is optimal for all patients. EUTOS long-term survival (ELTS) risk score, comorbidities, and treatment-free remission (TFR) priority are the key determinants of frontline TKI selection. Higher ELTS score, low age and comorbidity score, and a high priority for achievement of TFR would all favor the frontline use of a more potent TKI than imatinib. However, no TKI has improved survival compared with imatinib. In children with CP-CML, imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib have similar long-term efficacy, with ease of administration and impact of toxicities on quality of life being key considerations. Recent adult trials of reduced-dose dasatinib frontline showed that efficacy may be equivalent to standard-dose dasatinib with a better tolerability and safety profile, but experience is limited in patients with high-risk ELTS scores. The ASC4FIRST trial has confirmed that tolerability and molecular response with asciminib are superior to those with both imatinib and the second-generation (2G)-TKIs. While the overall treatment failure rate was lower with asciminib, the rate of BCR::ABL1 mutations that emerged with asciminib appeared to be higher. The risk of emergent mutations appears to be highly associated with the presence of <i>ASXL1</i> mutations in the CML cells at diagnosis, but more work is needed to understand the implications of this finding.",

Tobacco and alcohol consumption, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and Barrett's esophagus are associated with the development of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. To identify the clinical profile in patients with esophageal cancer at a tertiary care center. A cross-sectional, observational study. Patients with esophageal cancer were evaluated between January 2014 and July 2019. The study variables included sex, age, histological type, postoperative complications, mortality, and survival. A total of 34 patients were evaluated, with a mean age of 61.8 \u00b1 8.9 years. 88.2% were men. Tumor location was as follows: lower third (76.5%), middle third (17.6%), and upper third (5.9%). The most common histological types were adenocarcinoma (67.6%) and squamous cell carcinoma (32.4%). Symptoms included: dysphagia in 34 (100%) and epigastric pain in 20 (58.8%). The types of surgeries performed were: transhiatal in 15 (44.1%), palliative in 15 (44.1%), Ivor Lewis in 1 (2.9%), and McKeown in 1 (2.9%). Postoperative complications included: respiratory (29.4%), anastomotic leak (20.6%), sepsis (11.8%), and fistula (2.9%). Mortality was 13 (38.2%) patients, and survival at 22 months was 22%. Our study showed a higher prevalence of esophageal cancer in men over 60 years old with adenocarcinoma localized in the lower third of the esophagus. Despite chemotherapy treatment, patient survival remains poor due to late diagnosis in advanced stages of the disease, which limits tumor resectability and operability, leading to increased mortality.",

    "title": "Tumor-derived erythropoietin acts as an immunosuppressive switch in cancer immunity.",
    "abstract": "Successful cancer immunotherapy requires a patient to mount an effective immune response against tumors; however, many cancers evade the body's immune system. To investigate the basis for treatment failure, we examined spontaneous mouse models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with either an inflamed T cell-rich or a noninflamed T cell-deprived tumor microenvironment (TME). Our studies reveal that erythropoietin (EPO) secreted by tumor cells determines tumor immunotype. Tumor-derived EPO autonomously generates a noninflamed TME by interacting with its cognate receptor EPOR on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). EPO signaling prompts TAMs to become immunoregulatory through NRF2-mediated heme depletion. Removing either tumor-derived EPO or EPOR on TAMs leads to an inflamed TME and tumor regression independent of genotype, owing to augmented antitumor T cell immunity. Thus, the EPO/EPOR axis functions as an immunosuppressive switch for antitumor immunity.",

    "title": "Correction of stomach cancer CT attenuation values for variations due to differences in CT imaging conditions through repeated CT scans.",
    "abstract": "To develop methods for correcting variations in CT attenuation values of advanced gastric cancer (AGC) due to differences in CT imaging conditions using repeated pre-treatment CT scans. A total 211 patients (146 men) with AGC who underwent pre-treatment CT twice were included in this retrospective study. The Pearson correlation between the difference in tumor attenuation values measured on both CT scans and the difference in attenuation values of other organs was analyzed. A formula to correct tumor CT attenuation values was developed using univariate linear regression analysis. The Pearson correlation coefficient was the highest between the difference in tumor attenuation values and that of the main portal vein (MPV) attenuation values (0.86, P <.01). The formula to correct tumor attenuation values was as follows: calculated tumor attenuation value on CT scan 2 = tumor attenuation value on CT scan 1 - (-3.5 + 0.4 x (MPV attenuation value on CT scan 1 - MPV attenuation value on CT scan 2)). The mean difference between calculated and actual tumor attenuation values was 1.6 HU (SD, 8.7; range -22.5-24.72), with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.95 (P <.01). Utilizing the attenuation value of the MPV allows for correction of variations in tumor attenuation values caused by different CT imaging conditions, enabling the prediction of reproducible tumor attenuation in patients with AGC. Future studies are needed to validate these findings and address the study's limitations, including its retrospective design and the absence of unenhanced CT data. The attenuation value of the MPV can be used to predict reproducible tumor attenuation values in gastric cancer.",

    "abstract": "A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test is a simple blood test that is used to screen for prostate cancer. Over the last 30 years, the benefit of screening with a PSA test has been a matter of significant debate because of its association with overscreening, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment of prostate cancer. Although most prostate cancer screening guidelines recommend a shared decision-making approach between the patient and provider, these recommendations are contradictory in terms of screening initiation, frequency, and discontinuation as well as screening recommendations for high-risk populations. This article describes a literature review comparing screening guidelines with newer research in order to determine which guideline aligns most closely with the latest findings. Results show that the related American Urological Association and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, for example, may lead to over- or underscreening, whereas the American Cancer Society (ACS) guideline seems most closely in alignment with recent research. By following the ACS guideline, most clinically significant prostate cancer should be captured with less risk of overscreening and overdiagnosis.",

    "abstract": "The announcement of a diagnosis can be a source of anxiety for patients. Managing this anxiety is a major challenge, in terms of quality of life but also for the use of anxiolytic and analgesic therapies. The use of 3D modeling technology in partial nephrectomy surgery has proved its worth as a surgical aid but it could also help patients to manage their own care, by reducing their anxiety and increasing their understanding of the disease and its treatment. We aim to test this hypothesis with a prospective multicenter trial. R3DP-A (Rein 3D - Anxiety) is an unblinded, multicenter, randomized, prospective, superiority-controlled trial. Participants are patients with kidney tumors treated by robot-assisted partial laparoscopic nephrectomy. The 234 patients (78x3 groups) from 6 French centers will undergo a pre-operative consultation dedicated to a personalized explanation of the surgical management and its risks. They will be randomized into three (1:1:1) groups corresponding to three types of support for consultation: use of a virtual 3D model of the kidney and its tumor; a printed 3D model; or the standard information sheet from the French Association of Urology (control group). Several self-questionnaires will be sent by the UroConnect\u00ae application and completed at different times during the study. The primary endpoint will be pre-operative anxiety (STAI-state questionnaire completed the day before surgery D-1). Secondary endpoints will be changes in anxiety levels between the pre-operative and post-operative consultations (between inclusion and D15 post-op), changes in health literacy and quality of life (HLSEU-Q16 and EQ-5D-5L questionnaires at inclusion and D15), feelings of understanding of the disease and its treatment at pre-operative period (Wake questionnaire at D-1), and consultation times. We aim to highlight a benefit of using a personalized 3D model on the anxiety level of patients undergoing partial nephrectomy surgery, as well as on their level of understanding of their pathology and its surgical treatment. The use of these models could be incorporated into current practice to improve patient experience throughout care.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Extramedullary disease represents an aggressive form of multiple myeloma (MM), with breast secondary involvement being very rare. This localization makes differential diagnosis from primary breast cancer difficult, as clinical and radiological patterns are similar between these entities. CASE REPORT An 83-year-old patient, treated for immunoglobulin A (IgA) kappa, (1q21+) MM, diagnosed in April 2016, presented to the Emergency Department for a fall. Clinically, she presented with multiple, bilateral breast lesions, confirmed by mammography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Histology analysis documented a tumor with a solid and discreetly trabecular architecture, without calcifications or ductal/lobular in situ lesions, nor peritumoral lymphatic or vascular invasion. The tumor cells were negative for hormonal receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). This histological pattern was first mistaken for an aggressive, infiltrating, pleomorphic lobular primary breast carcinoma. However, because of the history of a concomitant MM and the discordance between the histological diagnosis showing a tumor with a triple negative phenotype and the immunohistochemical profile of the pleomorphic lobular breast cancer, which usually overexpresses hormonal receptors, a histological revision was undertaken, and this confirmed the diagnosis of a breast localization of MM as the tumor cells expressed IgA kappa and multiple myeloma oncogene 1 (MUM1), and were negative for AE1/AE3 cytokeratin. The patient started fifth-line chemotherapy, but her clinical condition quickly worsened, leading to her death in June 2023. CONCLUSIONS The particularity of this case relies on the rarity of extramedullary disease from MM. Its difficult diagnosis represents a clinical challenge, as does the complexity of its management, due to a lack of evidence-based medical data.",

    "abstract": "In juvenile granulosa cell tumors (juvGCTs), impaired survival was reported after preoperative tumor rupture, peritoneal metastases, or high mitotic rate (\u226520 mitoses per 10 high-power fields). Therefore, a risk stratification was developed to select patients for chemotherapy. Between 2001 and 2019, 89 female patients and 24 male patients were prospectively enrolled. Histopathologic classification was according to the World Health Organization classification, and staging was according to Children's Oncology Group and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics classification. Testicular juvGCTs were detected as scrotal swelling during infancy. No recurrences were reported after orchiectomy. Patients with ovarian juvGCTs presented at a median age of 9.8 years with abdominal discomfort, isosexual precocity, or amenorrhea. After tumor resection, two of 52 patients with stage IA disease, one of 14 with stage IC1 disease (intraoperative rupture), 13 of 18 with stage IC2 or IC3 disease (preoperative rupture), and all five patients with stage II/III disease received chemotherapy. Four recurrences with two deaths were reported. Three recurrent tumors were initially stage IA with a high mitotic rate, and one was a stage II tumor. No recurrences were observed among patients who had stage IC2/IC3 disease, who had unfavorable prognoses in historical cohorts. The 5-year event-free survival was 0.95\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 (85 of 89 patients), and overall survival was 0.97\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 (87 of 89 patients). Testicular and ovarian juvGCTs are clinically distinct entities. Although testicular juvGCTs exclusively present during infancy and have an excellent prognosis, ovarian juvGCTs may arise at any age and constitute potentially aggressive tumors. Centralized reference diagnostics and the establishment of counseling structures for the treatment of patients with ovarian juvGCTs improved prognosis compared with historical groups. The mitotic rate and incomplete surgery were identified as important risk factors in addition to tumor stage and should be considered in the risk-stratification of therapy.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor is a rare benign neoplasm affecting young adults and children. Although often considered benign, its locally aggressive nature and tendency to recur make its management immensely challenging, particularly without robust evidence to guide treatment. Surgical excision offers the best hope for a cure; however, this can lead to significant morbidity and may not always be possible, especially for multicentric diseases. We report a multicentric abdominal inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor in a 6-year-old girl who presented with massive abdominal distention. The sheer size of the mass, coupled with multicentric presentation and absent mobility on clinical examination, would have led to a very morbid surgical exploration. This patient was treated with initial chemotherapy, which led to a dramatic response in both symptoms and size of masses, facilitating a complete surgical resection with negligible postoperative morbidity.

    "title": "Causal Association Between Sleep Deprivation and Glioblastoma Risk: Insights from Multi-Omics Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that sleep deprivation may contribute to cancer risk. However, the genetic association between sleep deprivation and glioblastoma (GBM) remains unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the causal relationship between sleep traits and GBM using genome-wide association study (GWAS) data of sleep duration, sleeplessness, GBM, and immune cell traits from the UK Biobank and FinnGen databases. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were conducted to assess potential causal links between sleep traits and GBM risk. Mediation analysis was performed to identify immune mediators affected by sleep duration that might influence GBM development. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was utilized to examine cellular subpopulation changes in brain tissue from sleep-deprived (SD) and ad libitum sleep mice. Additionally, a mouse model of sleep deprivation was established for transcriptomic analysis. We found a significant causal association between reduced sleep duration and increased GBM risk (IVW OR\u2009=\u20096.000\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-5</sup>, P\u2009=\u20090.003, Bonferroni P\u2009=\u20090.025). Sleeplessness also emerged as a potential risk factor for GBM (OR-IVW\u2009=\u200920.221, P\u2009=\u20090.038). Mediation analysis identified CD80 expression on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) as a mediator in the association between sleep duration and GBM, with a mediation effect of 0.256. SnRNA-seq confirmed significant alterations in CD80\u2009+\u2009pDCs in sleep-deprived mice. Transcriptomic analysis of SD mice demonstrated upregulation of GBM-related markers (Egfr, Tert, and Mgmt) and associated signaling pathways. These findings suggest a potential causal link between insufficient sleep and increased GBM risk, highlighting the importance of sleep management for GBM patients.",

    "title": "CAR T-cell therapy in renal cell carcinoma: opportunities, challenges, and new strategies to overcome.",
    "abstract": "Immunotherapy is a biological treatment for cancer that utilizes substances sourced from live organisms. Immunotherapy encompasses several modalities, including monoclonal antibodies, therapeutic vaccinations, immune system modulators, T-cell transfer treatment, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). It may treat kidney cancer by modifying the immune system's reaction to cancerous cells. These medicines are delivered as ICIs or cytokines. Immunotherapy may sometimes be used with targeted therapies, such as CAR T-cell therapy, to improve outcomes in advanced cancer. Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is a kind of cancer immunotherapy using genetically engineered T cells to augment their capacity to eradicate cancer cells. Although CAR T-cell therapy has achieved success, it continues to have substantial limitations that necessitate further investigation. Antigen escape, inhibition and resistance in B-cell malignancies, and life-threatening CAR T-cell-associated toxicities, such as cytokine release syndrome, neurologic toxicities, and sustained cytopenias, are among their limitations. Renal cell carcinoma RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults. The surgical excision of a portion or the entire kidney is a common treatment for RCC. This procedure has the potential to cause agony, as well as organ and blood vessel injury. This study has examined the benefits of T cell therapy in the treatment of RCC, as well as the challenges and issues associated with this treatment method. It has also examined effective strategies for reducing the side effects, in light of the importance and incidence rate of this type of cancer.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have analyzed the prevalence of TERT amplification in thyroid cancer, showing discrepancies in various topics. The impact on tumor recurrence and patient survival in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) remains unknown. Thirteen cancer cell lines and 215 tumor samples from 91 patients, who underwent surgery for PTC (41), poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDC\u2009=\u200915), or anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC\u2009=\u200935), were analyzed. Clonality, spread with tumor dedifferentiation or metastatic PTC cells, and coexistence with TERTp, BRAF, RAS, and PIK3CA mutations were also investigated. TERT amplification was found in 17%, 20%, and 17% of the PTC, PDC, and ATC, respectively. It was more frequent in follicular variant PTC and PTC with distant metastases (86%, P\u2009=\u20090.0448). The cell lines HTh74, SW1736, and T242 had amplification. In PTC, TERT amplification was a subclonal event. The increase in TERT copy number spread in all cases with metastatic PTC cells. In 67% of the PDC and 100% of the ATC, TERT activation segregated with tumor dedifferentiation. TERT amplification correlated with TERTp mutations in PTC (P\u2009=\u20090.0313) and PIK3CA mutations in ATC (P\u2009=\u20090.0272). TERT amplification significantly correlated with vascular invasion (P\u2009=\u20090.03637), distant metastases at diagnosis and/or follow-up (P\u2009=\u20090.04482), metachronous distant metastases (P\u2009=\u20090.03131), death patient status (P\u2009=\u20090.000829), stage at diagnosis (P\u2009=\u20090.01995), and stage III/IV at last follow-up (P\u2009=\u20090.01552). TERT amplification associated independently with tumor-related recurrence and death. Our study shows that PTC can be stratified into clinically prognostic relevant categories based on the presence or not of TERT amplification in the cells.",

    "abstract": "Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is the most common malignant tumor of the salivary gland. MEC harboring MAML2 rearrangement has a favorable prognosis. This study investigated the histologic and locational diversity of head and neck mucoepidermoid carcinoma, clinicopathologic characteristics, and associations with CRTC1/3::MAML2 fusion. Patients with head and neck mucoepidermoid carcinoma (n\u2009=\u2009128) treated from February 2004 to December 2016 were included. Retrospective analysis encompassed clinical data, pathologic findings, and prognoses, with concurrent performance of fluorescence in situ hybridization to detect MAML2 rearrangement. The 128 head and neck mucoepidermoid carcinomas comprised 76 parotid gland, 29 oral cavity, 10 submandibular/sublingual, 8 pharynx, 2 lip, 2 sinonasal cavity, and 1 larynx MEC. The parotid gland was the most common site (59%), and the classic subtype was predominant (69%). MAML2 fusion was detected in 84% of analyzed cases and was strongly associated with low-grade tumors (P\u2009<\u20090.001). MAML2-negative cases exhibited higher rates of lymphovascular invasion, nodal metastasis, and poorer outcomes. Tumors in the parotid, submandibular gland, sublingual gland, oral cavity, and oropharynx, showed more frequent MAML2 rearrangement, than nasopharynx, larynx, lip, and paranasal sinus origin (P\u2009<\u20090.001). The classic and Warthin-like subtypes showed higher MAML2 rearrangement than other subtypes (P\u2009=\u20090.001). MAML2 fusion status was a statistically significant predictor of overall survival by univariate (P\u2009=\u20090.039) and multivariate (P\u2009=\u20090.048) analyses. The presence MAML2 fusion is a favorable prognostic marker in mucoepidermoid carcinoma, with its prevalence varying by location and subtype. Its varying prevalence across locations and subtypes highlights its significant prognostic relevance. These findings underscore the importance of molecular testing and histopathologic evaluation in predicting clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Despite advancements in medical research, cancer remains a significant and persistent cause of death globally. Cancer vaccine, a novel approach, holds immense promise in development of potentially effective cancer treatment. While the concept of developing cancer vaccines has been explored for decades, significant challenges have hindered their clinical translation. Recent researchers have introduced exosomes as the key element for novel cell-free approach of cancer vaccines. Exosomes are a type of extracellular vesicle (EVs) secreted by various cells. These tiny structures can transport and deliver important biomolecules, such as DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, and immune-stimulatory molecules, to stimulate the body's anti-tumor immune response. Their biocompatibility, targeting ability, immunogenicity, and a notable capacity to cross biological barriers nominate them as promising candidates for cancer vaccine development by addressing current challenges in cancer therapy. This review explores the current state of knowledge on the efficacy of exosomes from various sources for personalized cancer vaccine development, preclinical and clinical evaluations, along with the strategies to optimize immunogenicity and antigen presentation. We also discuss the challenges and potential solutions for overcoming tumor microenvironment-related hurdles, highlighting the promise of exosome-based approaches for cancer immunotherapy by developing a novel cell-free cancer vaccine in future.",

    "abstract": "Data on the natural history and management of cerebellar cavernous malformations (CMs) is limited. This study aims to identify factors associated with hemorrhage risk, assess management strategies, and compare outcomes between conservative and surgical management in patients with cerebellar CMs. We retrospectively reviewed 130 patients with cerebellar CMs treated at our center (1990-2023). Data on clinical presentation, lesion characteristics, management strategies, and outcomes were analyzed. Annual hemorrhage risk was calculated. Surgical outcomes were assessed based on the persistence of CM-related symptoms and the presence of postoperative complications. Statistical analyses identified factors associated with hemorrhage, symptomatic presentation, and surgical outcomes. Of 130 patients (53.8% female; median age of 48.5 years (IQR: 26.75)), 41 (31.5%) presented with hemorrhage, and 20 (15.4%) had focal neurological deficits. Median lesion size measured 12\u00a0mm (IQR 8\u00a0mm) in size and were primarily located in the hemispheres (n\u2009=\u200989, 68.5%), with fewer in the vermis (n\u2009=\u200921, 16.2%), peduncle (n\u2009=\u200920, 15.4%), and dentate nucleus (n\u2009=\u20099, 6.9%). The annual hemorrhage risk for incidental lesions was 1.19%, while rehemorrhage risk for initially hemorrhagic lesions was 8.35%. Surgery was performed in 31 patients (23.8%), mostly for hemorrhage (n\u2009=\u200915, 48.4%) or cerebellar symptoms (n\u2009=\u20097, 22.6%). Postoperative complications were reported in three patients. At a median follow-up of 1.11 years (IQR 5.15 years), 22 patients (18.2%) had persistent symptoms, two developed new symptoms, and two experienced worsening symptoms from hypertrophic olivary degeneration. There was no CM- related mortality, and only one patient experienced moderate CM-related disability (mRS\u2009=\u20093). Cerebellar CMs generally have a benign course with hemorrhage risks compared to supratentorial and brainstem lesions. Conservative management is recommended for incidental lesions, while surgery should be reserved for symptomatic, accessible cases.",

    "abstract": "We compare the success of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy between standard laparoscopy and robotic-assisted laparoscopy (RAL) in patients with endometrial cancer. Patients with uterine epithelial tumour types undergoing staging surgery were identified from January 2019 to March 2023. Included patients underwent a total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and attempted bilateral SLN biopsy with indigocyanine green (ICG) dye, utilising either standard laparoscopy or RAL. 298 patients met the inclusion criteria. 211 (70.8%) had standard laparoscopy and 87 (29.2%) underwent RAL. The RAL cohort had significantly higher median body mass index (BMI) compared to standard laparoscopy (37 vs. 28\u00a0kg/m<sup>2</sup>, p\u2009<\u20090.001). The overall rate of successful bilateral SLN biopsy was 66.8% (n\u2009=\u2009199), and at least one hemi-pelvis was successfully biopsied in 87.3% (n\u2009=\u2009260) of patients. There was no significant difference in bilateral SLN biopsy success between RAL and standard laparoscopy (60.9% vs 69.2%, p\u2009=\u20090.17). RAL was not predictive of bilateral SLN biopsy success in multivariate analysis (OR 1.10, p\u2009=\u20090.76). There was no difference in SLN biopsy location, number of nodes identified, or empty-packet dissections between the surgical approaches. Increasing age (OR 0.96, p\u2009=\u20090.002) and BMI (OR 0.94, p\u2009<\u20090.001) were significantly associated with reduced bilateral SLN biopsy success. Between the learning and experienced periods of the study, the bilateral SLN biopsy success rate improved significantly for RAL (40.6 vs. 72.7%, p\u2009=\u20090.03), which was not found with standard laparoscopy. The decision to perform RAL should consider multiple factors including surgeon experience. Future research should be directed towards prospective, randomised and BMI-matched cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Due to the possible influence of inflammation and gut microbiota in cancers. Fc gamma receptor IIb deficient (FcGRIIb-/-) and cyclic GMP-AMP synthase deficient (cGAS-/-) mice, the model with hyperinflammation and hypo-inflammation, respectively, were subcutaneously injected with MC38 cells (a murine colon cancer cell line). As such, the tumor burdens were most prominent in cGAS-/- mice, while FcGRIIb-/- mice demonstrated the least tumor sizes compared with wild-type (WT). Intra-tumoral mononuclear cells of FcGRIIb-/- (hematoxylin and eosin staining) were more prominent than other groups with the most dominant CD86-positive cells (mostly M1 proinflammatory macrophages) and the least CD206-positive cells (mostly M2 anti-inflammatory macrophages). While fecal microbiome analysis demonstrated a subtle difference among mouse strains with tumors at 24\u00a0days post-cancer injection, serum cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-23, IL-12p70, GM-CSF, IL-27, and IL-17A) (fluorescence-encoded bead multiplex assay) and the expansion of immune cells in the spleens of FcGRIIb-/- mice (flow cytometry) were more prominent than others. With bone marrow-derived macrophages, prominent M1 (LPS) and M2 polarization (IL4 and cancer supernatant) in FcGRIIb-/- and cGAS-/- macrophages, respectively, were demonstrated using polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry. The most prominent tumoricidal activity (percentage of F4/80-negative flexible780 viable dye-positive cells using flow cytometry) of LPS-stimulated FcGRIIb-/- macrophages compared with other groups supported dominant pro-inflammatory characteristics of FcGRIIb-/- macrophages. In conclusion, the protective and promoting effects of FcGRIIb-/- and cGAS-/- mice, respectively, against cancers are partly related to macrophage functions with a subtle correlation to fecal microbiota, and FcGRIIb inhibitors and cGAS enhancers might be helpful for cancer adjuvant treatment.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of motor eloquent brain metastases (BM) harbors an elevated risk of neurological deficits due to possible damage to motor-cortex and tracts. Preserving a good functional and neurological status is crucial to enable comprehensive oncologic treatment. Growing evidence promotes intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) with low voltage x-rays as alternative to adjuvant external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Aim of this study is to investigate the safety and feasibility of surgery with IORT in motor eloquent regions compared to adjuvant radiotherapy (RT). We performed a retrospective chart review analysis of patients undergoing surgery for motor eloquent BMs at our institution with either IORT or adjuvant RT. All patients were resected under intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM). We compared patient characteristics, the rate of neurological deficits along with IONM parameters, functional status (KPS) and adverse events (AE) in both groups. 33 patients were analyzed from which 25 underwent IORT and 8 adjuvant EBRT in motor eloquent BMs. New motor deficits occurred in 7/33 patients without significant difference between both groups after 30 days (IORT 4/25 vs. adj. RT 3/8; Chi [2]-test: p\u2009=\u20090.19). The KPS after surgery did not differ significantly between both groups (IORT: 90% [72.5-90] vs. adj. RT: 80% [70-90]; Mann-Whitney-U-test: p\u2009=\u20090.31). No patient experienced local tumor recurrence or radio necrosis. 9/33 patients experienced postoperative AEs until the 30\u00a0day follow up without significantly different rates between both groups (IORT 5/25 vs. adj.

    "abstract": "Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains a serious health concern due to its high prevalence and mortality rates. Identifying prognostic biomarkers is essential to improving patient outcomes and treatment strategies. DOCK9, a gene implicated in various cellular functions, may play a significant role in ESCC progression and prognosis. We analyzed RNA microarray datasets and single-cell RNA sequencing data to identify survival-associated genes in ESCC. Using protein expression analysis, we examined DOCK9 in ESCC tissues and assessed its functional impact on human umbilical vein endothelial cells to understand its role in angiogenesis. Additionally, we developed a 21-gene prognostic risk model, focusing on the relevance of DOCK9. Our findings revealed that DOCK9 expression is significantly reduced in ESCC tissues and correlates with poor survival outcomes. Functionally, DOCK9 was found to regulate angiogenesis and modulate the tumor-associated fibroblast environment in ESCC. Furthermore, the DOCK9/CD31 ratio emerged as a potential marker to predict immune therapy response in ESCC. DOCK9 serves as a prognostic biomarker in ESCC, influencing both angiogenesis and immune response, and could guide future therapeutic strategies, particularly in immunotherapy. This study highlights DOCK9's relevance in ESCC prognosis, supporting its potential role in tailored therapies aimed at angiogenesis and immune modulation.",

We retrospectively evaluated patients with brain metastases who were treated between 2010 and 2023. Post-operative HSRT was delivered in three or five fractions. The primary objective was to determine the effect of dose escalation and fractionation on LC. Secondary objectives included identifying factors associated with RN. Statistical analyses were conducted using Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests for categorical data and Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous variables (significance level: p\u2009<\u20090.05). After a median follow-up of 19 months, 34 patients out of 212 (16%) had local recurrence. A biologically effective dose (BED<sub>10</sub>)\u2009>\u200928.8\u00a0Gy was associated with better LC (p\u2009=\u20090.002), but no benefit was found for a BED<sub>10</sub>\u2009>\u200948\u00a0Gy.

    "abstract": "Cirrhosis is closely related to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), however, the regulation of circular RNA (circRNA) in HCC with cirrhotic background has not yet been well illustrated. In this study, high throughput circRNA sequencing was applied to identified candidate circRNAs in HCC samples with cirrhotic background. The biological function of candidate circRNA was validated in both in vitro and in vivo settings. Additionally, Alphafold 3, mass spectrometry analysis and immunofluorescence were employed to investigate the underlying mechanisms involved. We found circCEP70 exhibited significantly higher expression levels in cirrhotic HCC samples and showed a positive correlation with improved prognosis. The RNA binding protein U2AF2 was found to suppress the expression of circCEP70 in cirrhosis patients. In vitro and in vivo experiments, including CCK-8, EdU, plate cloning, transwell, scratch, subcutaneous tumor formation, liver metastasis in situ, and lung metastasis assays confirmed the anti-carcinogenic effects. Mechanistically, circCEP70 encoded a novel protein named CEP70-160aa, which interacted with PKM2 and hindered its translocation into the nucleus. This interaction led to reduce STAT3 phosphorylation in the nucleus, thus inhibiting HCC proliferation and metastasis. In cirrhotic microenvironment, circCEP70 prevented HCC proliferation and metastasis through PKM2/STAT3 axis, and RNA binding protein U2AF2 could inhibit circCEP70 expression.",

In this single-center retrospective cohort study (2019-2024), we analyzed 126 patients who underwent meningioma surgery, equally distributed between DVT and control groups. Multiple regression analysis was used to develop a predictive model incorporating clinical, laboratory, and surgical parameters. The model was validated using bootstrap resampling with 1000 iterations. Primary outcome was ultrasonography-confirmed DVT. The model achieved superior discrimination (derivation cohort: AUC\u2009=\u20090.83, 95% CI: 0.78-0.89; validation cohort: AUC\u2009=\u20090.81, 95% CI: 0.75-0.87) compared to existing risk assessment tools.

    "title": "Integrative analysis of taurine metabolism-related genes prognostic signature with immunotherapy and identification of ABCB1 and GORASP1 as key genes in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",
    "abstract": "Taurine is an amino acid with several physiological functions and has been shown to be involved in the anti-tumor of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells. However, the role of taurine metabolism-related genes (TMRGs) in NPC has not been reported. We integrated data from the Genecards, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Gene Expression Omnibus(GEO) databases to identify differentially expressed genes associated with taurine metabolism in NPC patients. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG analyses were conducted to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Subsequently, Cox regression and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analyses were performed to construct a taurine metabolism-related prognostic signature. Survival, medication sensitivity, and immunological microenvironment evaluations were performed to assess the prognostic utility of the model. Finally, immunohistochemistry (IHC) experiments were performed to validate the model's prognostic reliability. In addition, we further verified the reliability of our research results through molecular docking and single-cell sequencing. Our prognostic model was based on three pivotal TMRGs (ABCB1, GORASP1, and EZH2). Functional analysis revealed a strong association between TMRGs and miRNAs in cancer. Notably, increased risk scores correlated with worsening tumor malignancy and prognosis. Significant disparities in immune microenvironment, immune checkpoints, and drug sensitivity were observed between the high- and low-risk groups. The protein expression patterns of the selected genes in clinical NPC samples were validated using immunohistochemistry. Molecular docking verified the interaction between these three core genes and taurine, which was further supported by single-cell sequencing showing significant expression variation among different cell clusters in NPC. We had elucidated the functions, therapeutic potential, and prognostic significance of three key genes related to taurine metabolism in NPC through multidimensional research and experimental validation. This research provided valuable insights and potential avenues for improved NPC management.",

    "title": "Long-term side effects of testicular cancer and treatment (observational study of mortality and morbidity in testicular cancer survivors).",
    "abstract": "Testicular cancer (TC) is a rare cancer, but due to early age at diagnosis and excellent cure rates, there is a large cohort of survivors. Recent studies have highlighted the late side effects of treatments of TC, especially cisplatin-based chemotherapy. These complications make the survivorship care challenging with detrimental effects on health and prognosis of TC survivors (TCS). In this study, we provide a snapshot of common late side effects in TCS and a possible care pathway with a nurse-led specialised clinic. We invited TCS to participate in the study at one of the cancer centres in Ireland for a comprehensive screening using questionnaires, examination and blood tests. Further investigations were performed as indicated. Mortality was assessed through retrospective chart reviews. We recruited 78 TCS to participate in the study with a median of 129 months since diagnosis (range 60 to 304 months) and 3 who died in survivorship. Second malignant neoplasms accounted for all three mortalities. Most common conditions after 5 years of diagnosis were hypertension (40%), dyslipidaemia (55.6%), hypogonadism (~\u200945%), and high BMI (52%). The majority of conditions were diagnosed during screening, including two cases of coronary artery disease and one case of transient ischaemic attacks. TCS who received chemotherapy and were aged more than 30 years at the time of diagnosis had a higher prevalence of the late side effects. TC survivorship phase is marred by a range of late side effects. This remains a challenge for patients and healthcare workers as ambiguity surrounds the care pathways in the survivorship setting. We hope this nurse-led, specialised, screening clinic might improve the care and service provision for TC survivors.",

    "abstract": "Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy is an established immunotherapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC); however, the response variability of patients remains a challenge, necessitating insight into immune cell function. Previous studies established that a preexisting Th2 immune microenvironment correlates with a positive BCG therapy outcome. Therefore, in this study, we explored the role of mast cells (MCs) and eosinophils in bladder cancer as a potential predicting tool for BCG immunotherapy response. We investigated the effect of MCs and eosinophils on bladder cancer cell viability together with their chemotactic migration towards cancer cells in vitro. The effect of BCG on these immune cells was also evaluated. Moreover, we performed an orthotopic model of bladder cancer in MC- and eosinophil-deficient mice. Finally, to evaluate whether these immune cells predict the therapy response, 26 patient biopsies pre-BCG treatment were analyzed for MC and eosinophil numbers in the tissue and sequenced for gene expression. Eosinophils, but not MCs, reduced bladder cancer cell viability in vitro and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. However, addition of BCG did not increase these effects in vitro. Patient biopsy analysis and mRNA sequencing showed that neither cell type predicted long-term therapy responsiveness. Gene expression analysis suggested that extracellular matrix and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition factors could influence BCG therapy outcomes. Even though eosinophils exhibit anti-tumorigenic effects in bladder cancer, neither MCs nor eosinophils were predictive of the long-term BCG therapy response. However, our findings implicate that matrix-related factors may modulate BCG therapy responses.",

    "title": "International survey on training of dermatology residents in supportive oncodermatology: the RESCUE study.",
    "abstract": "The dermatological management of cancer patients with cutaneous adverse events occurring during and after oncologic treatment is known as supportive oncodermatology. This includes prevention, early identification, and mitigation of dermatologic toxicities. The aim of the international RESCUE (Residents' survey on training of dermatology residents in supportive oncodermatology) study was to ascertain the current level of expertise in supportive oncodermatology among dermatology residents. The European Task Force \"Dermatology for cancer patients\" and the US Oncodermatology Society developed an online questionnaire with 30 multiple-choice items. Responses were collected using qualitative ordinal data (yes/no, 1-5 ratings) and multiple-choice options. Ordinal range results were analyzed by aggregating responses 1\u2009+\u20092\u2009+\u20093 versus 4\u2009+\u20095, with 5 representing the highest grade (\"extremely confident\" or \"full training\"). A total of 442 dermatology residents from 20 countries replied. These participants reported receiving less comprehensive training in supportive oncodermatology (only 41% receiving complete training) compared to immunodermatology (75%), cutaneous oncology (75%), dermoscopy (64%), and dermatologic surgery (50%). Only 17% of the residents reported feeling confident in managing the dermatological toxicities associated with anticancer treatments. Residents also indicated receiving less education regarding toxicities related to endocrine therapies (28%). In particular, lower levels of competence were reported in managing nail, hair, and oral toxicities. A significant majority of residents (98%) deemed it essential to enhance training in dermatological toxicities associated with anticancer therapies during their oncology residency. The RESCUE study represents the first project assessing residents' education in supportive oncodermatology. To enable future generations of dermatologists to provide enhanced care for cancer patients, supportive oncodermatology training should be integrated in residency programs worldwide, corresponding to training in other subspecialties. A more practical approach should also be incorporated, including extended training in hair, nail, and oral toxicities, enhancing the competencies of dermatology residents in all countries.",

    "abstract": "Nerves are integral to the adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) microenvironment. The strong association of ACC with perineural invasion (PNI) is considered a hallmark of this disease. In human salivary ACC, we identify intratumoral, small-caliber, disorganized sympathetic nerves not observed in other salivary neoplasms. Norepinephrine or sympathetic ganglia explants enhance ACC proliferation in vitro. Two novel orthotopic ACC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models recapitulate ACC morphology and demonstrate sympathetic innervation. Pharmacologic or surgical blockade of sympathetic nerves decreases ACC PDX growth. Bulk RNA sequencing of salivary ACC reveals correlations between noradrenergic nerve development signatures and worse patient survival. Metastatic ACC foci exhibit lower nerve signature gene expression levels than primary ACC. Sympathetic innervation in ACC is distinct from PNI and reflects tumor axonogenesis driven by noradrenergic neural development programs. These programs support ACC progression, are associated with poor prognosis, and may be inhibited as a therapeutic strategy.",

    "abstract": "In healthy cells, cyclin D1 is expressed during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, where it activates CDK4 and CDK6. Its dysregulation is a well-established oncogenic driver in numerous human cancers. The cancer-related function of cyclin D1 has been primarily studied by focusing on the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma (RB) gene product. Here, using an integrative approach combining bioinformatic analyses and biochemical experiments, we show that GTSE1 (G-Two and S phases expressed protein 1), a protein positively regulating cell cycle progression, is a previously unrecognized substrate of cyclin D1-CDK4/6 in tumor cells overexpressing cyclin D1 during G1 and subsequent phases. The phosphorylation of GTSE1 mediated by cyclin D1-CDK4/6 inhibits GTSE1 degradation, leading to high levels of GTSE1 across all cell cycle phases. Functionally, the phosphorylation of GTSE1 promotes cellular proliferation and is associated with poor prognosis within a pan-cancer cohort. Our findings provide insights into cyclin D1's role in cell cycle control and oncogenesis beyond RB phosphorylation.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to compare the retinal thickness, vessel density, and perfusion density in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and healthy controls using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography. And investigating the influence of serological parameters and carcinoma signs with retinal structural and microcirculatory in PTC patients. This cross-sectional study included 174 PTC patients (345 eyes) and 179 healthy subjects (358 eyes). Serological parameters (complete blood count, thyroid function, and lymphocyte subsets) and retinal thickness and flow parameters were compared between the two groups, and the correlations of retinal parameters with serological parameters in the PTC group. We investigated the effect of carcinoma signs (tumor size, focus location, lymphatic metastasis, surrounding tissue invasion, and BRAF mutations) on retinal parameters. PTC patients exhibited significantly thinner retinal thickness and reduced vessel density and perfusion density in the macular superficial vascular plexus compared with healthy controls. Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratios and thyroglobulin were inversely correlated with retinal parameters, and CD4+ T cells were positively correlated. Aggressive carcinoma signs thicken the retinal thickness more than nonaggressive cases. The findings indicate a trend toward macular thinning and retinal microcirculatory dysfunction in the PTC patients, and these changes may be related to chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation secondary to cancer progression. OCT and OCT angiography show potential as noninvasive tools for detecting subclinical retinal abnormalities in PTC patients, and retinal alterations may serve as a surrogate marker for systemic inflammation. However, further studies are needed to address confounders and establish causality.",

A total of 15 patients with intraorbital and intracranial meningioma presented to our neuro-ophthalmology clinic over 4 months. These cases of meningioma presented primarily to us with ophthalmic features and were diagnosed by us. Complete neuro-ophthalmic evaluation, including ocular examination, fundus, color vision, visual field, cranial nerve examination, was performed for each case and neuroimaging in the form of MRI brain with orbit with contrast. Clinical presentation of each case and site and extension of meningioma in neuroimaging was analyzed. Among 15 patients, age range was from 26-72 years, with mean age of 56 years. A total of 27% of patients were male, and 73% were female. A total of nine out of 15 cases were histologically proven. Chiasmal compression was observed on neuroimaging in 53% of patients. A total of 10 patients (66.67%) presented with complaints of defective vision, and five patients (33.33%) had double vision as their presenting symptom. Clinical examination revealed signs of sixth cranial nerve involvement in 20%, multiple cranial nerve paresis in 20%, and third cranial nerve palsy in 13%. A total of 47% of patients did not have any cranial nerve involvement. Visual field examination revealed homonymous hemianopia in 13% of patients. On fundus examination, 40% had bilateral optic atrophy, and 7% presented with papilledema. Visual field defects were documented and corelated with location of meningioma. Our study emphasizes the role of ophthalmologists in early detection of meningioma as many patients present first with subtle ophthalmological signs and symptoms before developing neurological symptoms.",

    "abstract": "The third edition of The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology includes category IV, follicular neoplasm (FN), which is used to classify fine-needle aspirates of thyroid nodules that may correspond to invasive follicular-derived neoplasia other than papillary thyroid carcinoma. This diagnosis is infrequently rendered, and may represent a challenge for pathologists. This review presents a practical approach to FN and its subtype oncocytic follicular neoplasm (OFN). First, minimal criteria for the diagnosis must be achieved, namely sufficient cellularity, architectural features consistent with neoplasia, and follicular cell or oncocytic cytomorphology. Second, select diagnoses that are common or important differential diagnoses for FN or OFN must be ruled out, via a combination of morphological findings and limited ancillary tests, when available. These include follicular nodular disease, parathyroid sampling, metastatic carcinoma, noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features, medullary thyroid carcinoma, certain subtypes of papillary thyroid carcinoma, and lymphocytic thyroiditis. This approach should allow for a careful selection of cases where diagnostic thyroid lobectomy is an appropriate therapeutic modality.",

Paraffin-embedded samples from 40 duodenal carcinoma cases were analyzed using immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray to assess CDX2 expression and its prognostic significance. CDX2 overexpression plasmids and CDX2-siRNA were transfected into colon and duodenal cancer cells. Transfection efficiency was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Cell proliferation was assessed using CCK8 assay, migration via scratch assay, and cell cycle and apoptosis by flow cytometry. CDX2 staining was primarily nuclear, with a positive rate of 65% in duodenal carcinoma tissues, significantly lower than in adjacent non-tumor tissues (p<0.05). CDX2-positive patients had better prognoses than negative patients (p<0.05). Reduced CDX2 expression significantly enhanced the proliferation of CaCO2 and HuTu-80 cells (p<0.001), whereas CDX2 overexpression suppressed proliferation (p<0.001). CDX2 knockdown increased migration, while its overexpression reduced migration (p<0.05). CDX2 overexpression led to a significant increase in G0/G1 phase cells and a decrease in S phase cells (p<0.05), whereas knockdown reduced G0/G1 phase cells and increased S and G2/M phase cells (p<0.05). Apoptosis was significantly increased following CDX2 overexpression (p<0.001) and decreased after CDX2 knockdown (p<0.001). CDX2 expression is downregulated or lost in duodenal carcinoma, acting as a tumor suppressor.

    "abstract": "Purpose To estimate the extent in which coronary artery calcium (CAC) score and incident lung cancer diagnosis are associated and determine if use of CAC score to predict lung cancer could improve lung cancer screening (LCS). Materials and Methods This retrospective analysis analyzed data from an ongoing, prospective, population-based cohort study (Heinz Nixdorf Recall study) in which participants aged 45-75 years underwent electron-beam CT of the heart. The association between CAC score and incident lung cancer was assessed using Cox proportional hazard regression models adjusted for potential confounders. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess predictive performance of CAC score for lung cancer in all participants, eligible participants, and ineligible participants for LCS. Results The study included 4605 participants (mean age, 59.7 [SD, 7.8] years; 2328 female). During a median follow-up time of 15.2 years, incident lung cancer was diagnosed in 111 participants. CAC score as a continuous variable (log CAC+1) was associated with incident lung cancer (hazard ratio [HR] in the fully adjusted model: 1.21 [95% CI: 1.10, 1.32]). A CAC score of 400 or higher versus 0 was associated with a more than fourfold higher risk of lung cancer (adjusted HR: 4.31 [95% CI: 2.19, 8.51]). CAC score alone showed poor performance for predicting lung cancer in the total study sample (AUC, 0.63) and subgroups of participants eligible (AUC, 0.56) and ineligible (AUC, 0.61) for LCS.

    "title": "Anti-Tumour Immunity Relies on Targeting Tissue Homeostasis Through Monocyte-Driven Responses Rather Than Direct Tumour Cytotoxicity.",
    "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) can progress to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), yet the immune mechanisms driving this transition remain unclear. In a chronic Western diet (WD) mouse model, we performed single-nuclei RNA sequencing to track MAFLD progression into HCC and subsequent tumour inhibition upon dietary correction. Carcinogenesis begins during MAFLD, with tumour cells entering dormancy when HCC is mitigated. Rather than purely tolerogenic, the liver actively engages immune responses targeting myofibroblasts, fibroblasts and hepatocytes to maintain tissue homeostasis. Cytotoxic cells contribute to the turnover of liver cells but do not primarily target the tumour. NKT cells predominate under chronic WD, while monocytes join them in HCC progression on a WD. Upon dietary correction, monocyte-driven immunity confers protection against HCC through targeting tissue homeostatic pathways and antioxidant mechanisms. Crucially, liver tissue response-not merely immune activation-dictates whether tumours grow or regress, emphasising the importance of restoring liver tissue integrity. Also, protection against HCC is linked to a distinct immunological pattern, differing from healthy controls, underscoring the need for immune reprogramming. These findings reveal the dual roles of similar pathways, where immune patterns targeting different cells shape distinct outcomes. Restoring tissue homeostasis and regeneration creates a tumour-hostile microenvironment, whereas tumour-directed approaches fail to remodel the TME. This underscores the need for tissue remodelling strategies in cancer prevention and treatment.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the predictive value of the radiographic tumor burden score (TBS) for long-term outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients meeting Milan criteria after microwave ablation (MWA) and to delineate its significance in guiding treatment planning. Retrospective analysis was conducted on clinical data from 198 HCC patients meeting Milan criteria, who underwent MWA at our hospital from January 2011 to December 2018. Using X-tile software, the optimal critical value of TBS was determined, leading to the categorization of patients into high- and low-TBS groups. Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to balance covariates between these groups. Before PSM, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate in the high-TBS (47 cases) and low-TBS groups (151 cases) were 32.8% versus 59.7% (p\u2009=\u20090.033) and 23.4% versus 50.9% (p\u2009=\u20090.016), respectively. Following PSM, the 5-year OS rate and RFS rate in the high-TBS (44 cases) and low-TBS groups (95 cases) were 30.2% versus 64.1% (p\u2009=\u20090.011) and 21.9% versus 45.9% (p\u2009=\u20090.0059), respectively. Cox analysis identified high TBS and percutaneous microwave ablation (PMWA) as independent risk factors for OS and RFS. The stratified analysis revealed that the median RFS time for patients undergoing laparoscopic microwave ablation (LMWA) (20 cases) and PMWA (24 cases) in the high-TBS group (44 cases) was 45 and 10.5\u2009months, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.006). TBS emerged as a robust predictor for the long-term outcomes of HCC within Milan criteria after MWA. A higher TBS was associated with a diminished long-term survival rate. Notably, among HCC patients meeting Milan criteria, those with TBS >\u20093 exhibited a prolonged median RFS time following LMWA compared to PWMA.",

These results suggest the benefit of PRRT and the potential PFS and OS benefit of <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE should not be based on tumor shrinkage (objective response versus stable disease) and that lack of tumor shrinkage should not impact application of the approved four cycles of <sup>177</sup>Lu-DOTATATE.",

    "abstract": "Statistics Canada uses two self-report measures - Ancestry and Identity - in the Canadian Census to identify First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis (FNIM) peoples. How these measures are employed alone or in combination to assess definitional impact on the reporting of health conditions has not been investigated. To illustrate, we assessed how these measures, alone or in combination, estimate colorectal cancer rates. A working group comprised of Indigenous and non-Indigenous academics assessed the response patterns to the Identity and Ancestry questions in the 2006 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort and categorised the responses into groups: A) Identity only; B) Ancestry only; C) any Ancestry or Identity; D) both Ancestry and Identity. We then assessed concordance, and subsequently examined the way these groupings may impact the reporting of colorectal cancer rates (2010-2015). FNIM responses varied across the different combinations of the Ancestry and Identity questions. Concordance for FNIM was 76%, 81%, and 18% respectively for single responses, which impacted the estimation of colorectal cancer rates. To improve health reporting, it is essential that research teams choose the most appropriate definition in partnership with FNIM and urban Indigenous organisations to ensure the right data are analysed to align with community priorities.",

    "abstract": "While current evidence suggests that the clinical outcomes of STEMI are worse among patients with cancer, it is unknown what role the patient's socioeconomic status plays. A nationally linked cohort of STEMI patients (January 2005 to March 2019) was obtained from the MINAP and UK national Hospital Episode Statistics (HES APC) registries. Socioeconomic status was measured using Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) score divided into 5 quintiles (quintile 1: most affluent, quintile 5: most deprived). The impact of socioeconomic status on clinical outcomes was assessed using Cox-proportional-hazard and competing risk models. A total of 8459 STEMI admissions with cancer were identified between 01/01/2005 and 30/03/2019 with 1577 patients (18%) from the most deprived quintile. Patients from the most deprived quintile were more frequently female (quintile 5; 29% vs. quintile 1; 24%) and from ethnic minorities (quintile 5; 8% vs. quintile 1; 2%). They were less likely to receive PCI between 2005 and 2009. By 2018 PCI use was higher in quintile 5 (quintile 5; 84% vs. quintile 1;81%). The odds of death at1year was not higher in the most deprived patients. The risk of death was significantly higher at 5 years post-discharge (HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.10-1.47). The socioeconomic status impact on outcomes of STEMI patients with cancer can be minimized by delivering equitable inpatient care, particularly PCI. While patients from the most deprived areas have similar odds of survival in the short-term, they have lower probability of survival in the long-term.",

    "abstract": "Glutamate is well-known as metabolite for maintaining the energy and redox homeostasis in cancer, moreover it is also the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. However, whether glutamatergic signaling can regulate hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression and the specific regulatory mechanisms are unknown. In the present study, we found that glutamate and its receptor NMDAR2B were significantly elevated in HCC patients, which predicts poor prognosis. Glutamate could upregulate CCL2 expression on hepatoma cells and further enhance the capability of tumor cells to recruit tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Mechanistically, glutamate could facilitate CCL2 expression through NMDAR pathway by decreasing the expression of EZH2, which regulates the H3K27me3 levels on the CCL2 promoter, rather than affecting DNA methylation. Moreover, inhibiting glutamate pathway with MK801 could significantly delay tumor growth, with reduced TAMs in implanted Hepa1-6 mouse HCC models. Our work suggested that glutamate could induce CCL2 expression to promote TAM infiltration by negatively regulating EZH2 levels in hepatoma cells, which might serve as a potential prognostic marker and a therapeutic target for HCC patients.",

This study evaluates the impact of TIL levels and Ki67 suppression on neoadjuvant therapy efficacy in this patient population. A retrospective analysis of 136 HER2-positive breast cancer patients was conducted. Patients were stratified by TIL levels, and clinical outcomes, including Ki67 expression, pathological complete response (pCR), and disease-free survival (DFS), were assessed. High TIL levels (\u2265\u200540%) were significantly associated with higher pCR rates (60.32% vs. 39.73%, P\u2005=\u2005.02) and with TIL\u2005\u2265\u200510% greater Ki67 suppression. In patients with low TIL levels, high Ki67 expression correlated with better pCR rates (57.1% vs 30.8%, P\u2005=\u20050.010), while in high TIL patients, no significant difference was observed between high and low Ki67 groups (P\u2005=\u20050.317). A trend toward improved DFS was noted in the high TIL group, with 3-year survival rates of 91.9% vs. 80.7% in the low TIL group, though this was not statistically significant (P\u2005=\u2005.062). TIL levels are robust predictors of pCR and Ki67 suppression in HER2-positive breast cancer, particularly in patients with high initial TILs. These findings highlight the potential for integrating TIL evaluation into personalized treatment strategies to optimize neoadjuvant therapy outcomes. Further research is warranted to validate these results and explore underlying mechanisms.",

The two main surgical treatment options for GCTB are intralesional curettage and en-bloc resection. This study examined the long-term GCTB recurrence rates among Tunisian patients after surgery. A study including 36 patients diagnosed with GCTB was conducted. These patients underwent surgical procedures, specifically intralesional curettage and in bloc resection. Subsequently, we monitored these patients for a two-year post-operative period. Statistical analyses, including Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox proportional hazards regression, and chi-square tests, were performed to identify and evaluate factors associated with local recurrence. Our analysis showed a significant association between surgical treatment and the occurrence of local recurrence (<i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.01). Interestingly, the rate of local recurrence was notably higher among patients who underwent intralesional curettage (13 out of 21; 61%) compared to those who received en bloc resection (2 out of 15; 13%) (all <i>p</i>\u2009<\u20090.01). En-bloc resection is a reliable treatment choice for GCTB, demonstrating a lower risk of recurrence compared to intralesional curettage. These findings highlight the importance of selecting the appropriate surgical approach to minimize recurrence and improve patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "We described disruptions in cancer-related healthcare appointments and perceived quality of healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic and identified predictors, including socioeconomic factors, of perceived quality of healthcare among cancer survivors. In this cross-sectional study, we used 2021 Health Information National Trends Survey-Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data from Iowa, Greater Bay Area (California), and New Mexico cancer registries. Among cancer survivors who visited a healthcare provider in the past 12-months (N\u2009=\u20091130), we reported weighted prevalence of disruptions in (cancelled and/or changed to telehealth) routine cancer screening, disruptions in cancer treatment or follow-up, and perceived quality of healthcare, by registry. Using logistic regression, we identified predictors associated with perceived quality of healthcare, adjusting for sex and age. Among cancer survivors with scheduled appointments, 25.0% (Iowa) to 39.6% (California) reported disrupted cancer screening and 16.6% (Iowa) to 33.9% (California) reported disrupted treatment or follow-up related to their cancer diagnosis. 12.5% (Iowa) to 22.5% (New Mexico) of survivors perceived suboptimal quality of healthcare. Survivors with disrupted cancer screening, lower education and income, longer wait times for results, did not spend enough time with their doctor, and did not receive assistance with health uncertainty had increased odds of perceiving suboptimal quality of healthcare (odds ratio range\u2009=\u20092.64-19.31). Disruptions in cancer screening, lower socioeconomic status, and negative patient experiences were associated with poorer perceived quality of healthcare. Continued efforts are needed to address existing disparities to ensure equitable access to quality of healthcare post-pandemic.",

Simultaneous high-risk HPV testing with partial genotyping and LBC testing was performed. Comparison of clinical efficacy of HPV testing and LBC was performed for routine screening discharge rate, colposcopy referral rate, and number of colposcopies needed for each CIN2+ detected.ResultsOf 6398 women included, 503 women (7.9%) tested positive for HPV DNA. The positivity was higher for 25-to-29 years old than for women \u226530\u00a0years old (12.6% vs 7.3%, <i>P</i> < .001). The rate was markedly skewed by a low rate for women \u226545\u00a0years old. Similarly, more women below 30\u00a0years old (10.6%) had abnormal LBC results compared to women \u226530\u00a0years old (6.0%). Comparing LBC and HPV testing, the observed difference was not significant for discharge rate to interval screening (89.5% vs 87.4%). A higher referral to coloscopy rate (6.6 % vs 7.8%) was observed for HPV screening but the number of colposcopies for each detected CIN2+ (5 vs 7) was not significantly different. Clinical efficacy of HPV and LBC testing was similar in comparisons of women in 5-year groupings between 25 and 44\u00a0years old.ConclusionsOur data indicated that cervical screening for women between 25 and 29\u00a0years old could adopt HPV screening as the older women.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer worldwide and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men. The emergence of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) after androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) exemplifies the complex disease management for PCa. PARP inhibitors (PARPis) are being tested to treat mCRPC in tumors with defective homologous recombination repair (HRR) to address this complexity. However, increasing resistance towards PARPi in HRR-deficient patients and the low percentage of HRR-defective mCRPC patients requires the identification of new genes whose deficiency can be exploited for PARPi treatment. XRCC1 is a DNA repair protein critical in the base excision repair (BER) and single strand break repair (SSBR) pathways. We analyzed PCa patients' cohorts and found that XRCC1 expression varies widely, with many patients showing low XRCC1 expression. We created XRCC1 deficiency in PCa models to examine PARPi sensitivity. XRCC1 loss conferred hypersensitivity to PARPi by promoting the accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks, increasing cell-cycle arrest, and inducing apoptosis. We confirmed that XRCC1 expression correlated with PARPi sensitivity using a doxycycline-inducible system. Therefore, we conclude that XRCC1 expression level predicts response to PARPi, and the clinical utility of PARPi in PCa can extend to low XRCC1 expressing tumors.",

Patients with the highest number of disrupted m<sup>6</sup>A sites or newly generated m<sup>6</sup>A motifs did not generally exhibit alterations in mortality risk or outcomes. Hence, our data suggest that mutational alterations in the m<sup>6</sup>A motif landscape are unlikely to be a primary mechanism for regulating gene function across most cancer types.

    "abstract": "Glioma is a major cause of mortality among central nervous system tumors, with a generally poor prognosis. The lysyl oxidase (LOX) family, a group of copper-dependent amine oxidases, has been implicated in the progression of various cancers, but its specific role in glioma and its relationship with immune infiltration remains insufficiently explored. This study aims to investigate the LOX family's expression, prognostic significance, and immune infiltration dynamics in glioma to identify potential therapeutic targets. A comprehensive analysis was conducted using public databases to assess gene expression, mutation frequency, and immune infiltration patterns related to the LOX family in glioma. The results were validated through survival analysis and immunohistochemistry. Functional assays, including EdU, Transwell, and flow cytometry, were used to evaluate glioma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. Co-culture experiments with immune cells, ELISA, and a glioma transplantation model were employed to study the immune-modulatory effects of the LOX family. Gene and protein expression levels were further analyzed using qRT-PCR and Western blotting. The LOX family was significantly upregulated in low-grade gliomas and strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes. Although mutation frequencies were low, the LOX family contributed to glioma progression through pathways involving metastasis, hypoxia response, angiogenesis, and immune cell infiltration. LOX expression correlated with increased infiltration of macrophages and eosinophils and decreased presence of Treg and CD8+ T cells. Knockdown of LOX genes impaired glioma cell functions, induced apoptosis, and altered immune cell behavior by reducing M2 macrophage polarization and enhancing CD8+ T cell activity. The LOX family is overexpressed in glioma and is associated with poor prognosis and altered immune infiltration patterns. These findings highlight the LOX family as a promising prognostic marker and therapeutic target, particularly for enhancing the effectiveness of immunotherapy in glioma treatment.",

    "abstract": "Gemcitabine (GEM), a nucleoside analog chemotherapy agent, has been widely used in the treatment of various cancers. In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding the immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive effects of GEM. The immunomodulatory roles of GEM could influence the anti-tumor immune responses via several mechanisms, such as modulation of antigen presentation, cytokine production, and immune cell population. Furthermore, there is evidence that GEM enhances the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapies, including oncolytic viruses, immune checkpoint inhibitors, CAR T-cells, and therapeutic vaccines. On the other hand, accumulating evidence also proposed that GEM may act as an immunosuppressive agent within the tumor microenvironment, resulting in immune evasion of tumor cells and tumor growth. These paradoxical roles of GEM in modifying immune responses highlight the complexity of GEM interaction with immune cells and responses within the tumor microenvironment. This review aims to provide an overview of the immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive effects of GEM within the tumor microenvironment and how GEM affects the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.",

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hypofractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) in locally advanced NSCLC patients with low-TMB compared to conventional fractionated radiotherapy (CFRT). We retrospectively analyzed clinical outcomes of 74 locally advanced NSCLC patients with low-TMB undergoing definitive radiotherapy from January 2017 to July 2023, with 31 patients received HFRT (received radiation doses of >2Gy and \u22645 Gy per fraction) and 43 received CFRT (received radiation doses of 1.8-2 Gy per fraction). Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR) to radiotherapy was analyzed in the two groups. Univariate analysis was performed to assess the impact of clinical characteristics on PFS. We also analyzed PFS in subgroups receiving HFRT or CFRT combined with immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Survival analysis revealed the median PFS of 13 months in the HFRT group was significantly better than the 10 months in the CFRT group (p = 0.024). The 6-month and 12-month PFS rates were 80.6% and 61.3% for the HFRT group, versus 81.4% and 39.5% for the CFRT group, respectively. Median OS was 27 months in the HFRT group and 20 months in the CFRT group (p = 0.079). There were no statistically significant differences in major adverse events between the HFRT and CFRT groups (all p>0.05). In the subgroup receiving combined immunotherapy and chemotherapy, the median PFS was 10 months in the HFRT group and 9 months in the CFRT group (p = 0.092). HFRT was superior to CFRT in prolonging PFS for patients with low-TMB locally advanced NSCLC. It was a safely and effective approach for these patients and was worth further prospective studies with larger sample sizes.",

To maximize the ease and accessibility of obtaining <i>in vivo</i> tissue metabolism and vasculature measurements, we aim to develop our new metabolic imaging tool with minimal cost and size, allowing one to easily quantify tissue metabolic and vascular endpoints together <i>in vivo</i>, advancing many critical biomedical inquiries. We have combined fluorescence microscopy and dark-field microscopy in a re-emission geometry into one portable microscope to image the key metabolic and vascular endpoints on the same tissue site. The portable microscope was first characterized by tissue-mimicking phantoms. Then the multi-parametric system was demonstrated on small animals to image glucose uptake (using 2-NBDG) and mitochondrial membrane potential (using TMRE) along with vascular parameters (oxygen saturation and hemoglobin contents) of orthotopic tongue tumors <i>in vivo</i>. Our phantom studies demonstrated the capability of the portable microscope for effective measurements of several key vascular and metabolic parameters with a comparable accuracy compared with our former reported benchtop spectroscopy and imaging systems. Our <i>in vivo</i> animal studies revealed increased glucose uptake and mitochondrial membrane potential along with reduced vascular oxygenation in tongue tumors compared with normal tongue tissues. The spatial analysis of metabolic and vascular images showed a more heterogeneous metabolic and oxygenation profile in tongue tumors compared with normal tongue tissues. Our <i>in vivo</i> animal studies demonstrated the capability of our portable multi-parametric microscope for imaging the key metabolic and vascular parameters at the same tissue site with about one hour delay using an orthotopic tongue tumor model <i>in vivo</i>. Our study showed the potential of a portable functional microscope to noninvasively evaluate tumor biology using orthotopic tongue cancer models for future head and neck cancer research.",

    "title": "The size distribution of nanoparticles emitted from advanced manufacturing devices impacts predicted carcinogenic potential.",
    "abstract": "Advanced manufacturing devices such as 3D printers bring users into closer contact with processes that generate ultrafine particles or release engineered nanomaterials. While approaches to assessing the risk of lung carcinogenesis and related health effects are developing, serious questions exist regarding the impact such devices may have on human health and safety if proper actions (i.e., engineering controls including ventilation or filtration) are not taken to mitigate exposures. The size distribution of particulates emitted during fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing was measured following the ANSI/CAN/UL 2904 method and associated lung cancer risk was estimated through a developing model. Particulate morphologies were assessed, identifying agglomerative and morphological characteristics which may further impact health effects. The estimation of excess lung cancer risk for 3D printer emissions based upon particle size was found to vary according to aerodynamic diameter distribution and emitted concentration, with values projected as high as 468 cases per 10,000 workers in the measured exposure scenario (1\u202fm<sup>3</sup> enclosure with air fully exchanged once per hour); predicted excess lung cancer risk was found to drop significantly as print extrusion temperature decreased. Actual health impacts will depend highly upon the exposure scenario, as room air volume, ventilation, and number of printers in operation will impact the concentration of particulates present. This model provides a means for assessing excess lung cancer risk across a broad aerodynamic diameter distribution, improving resolution over methods that use a single particle size bin such as PM2.5 or PM10. The effects of particle composition are only anecdotally considered in this model, however; this limitation should be accommodated as the model is implemented in practical settings.",

    "abstract": "The growing body of litigation alleging bodily injury from per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure has put a spotlight on the available scientific literature regarding potential human health impacts, and the various data gaps within the literature. This review assesses the evolution of epidemiological findings for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a PFAS compound. In 2012, the C8 Science Panel published a series of reports determining \"probable links\" for certain health outcomes (including kidney cancer and thyroid disease); it was the first major research effort investigating potential adverse health effects following exposure to PFOA. At that time, there were only a handful of available studies investigating human effects (i.e., epidemiological studies). Now, over a decade later, the epidemiological body of literature for PFOA has grown substantially. As is the nature of evolving science, the additional research has spotlighted important improvements in exposure classification, confounding control, and statistical methods that strengthen more recent scientific investigations. As the body of epidemiological literature for PFAS health effects grows and evolves with improved methodology, the original C8 Science Panel's conclusions have not been supported by more recent investigations. Within the context of general causation, while gaps remain in the body of research, more recent epidemiological findings support that there is no causal relationship between PFOA exposure and kidney cancer or thyroid disease.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is one of the leading malignant women tumors that causes higher mortality, and immunotherapy has shown high potential in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer patients by activating and mobilizing the human immune system, which can improve patient prognosis and survival. Natural compounds are a big resource for screening and finding effective lead compounds to treat diseases. Gallic acid (GA) is a natural organic acid with broad-spectrum antibacterial, antiviral, and antitumor effects. In the current study, we aim to explore the effect of GA on ovarian cancer and its underlying mechanisms. The CCK-8 assay was employed to study its anti-proliferation effect and wound healing, and transwell assay was utilized to test the GA effect on cell migration and invasion. The xenograft tumor model was used to evaluate the GA anticancer effect in vivo. The results demonstrated that GA significantly suppresses the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, reduces their migration and invasion capability, and enhances macrophage cytotoxicity in the murine ID8 xenograft tumor microenvironment (TME). The mechanism study demonstrated that its anticancer effect and enhancing immunity is stem from inhibiting the PI3k-AKT pathway. In conclusion, GA plays an anticancer effect via blockage of the PI3K-AKT pathway.",

    "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> This study aimed to develop and validate a straightforward clinical risk model utilizing white blood cell (WBC) counts to predict acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically sick patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). <b>Methods:</b> Data were taken from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) database for the training cohort. Data for an internal validation cohort were obtained from the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD), while patients from our hospital were utilized for external validation. A risk model was created utilizing significant indicators identified through multivariate logistic regression, following logistic regression analysis to determine the primary predictors of WBC-related biomarkers for AKI prediction. The Kaplan-Meier curve was employed to evaluate the prognostic efficacy of the new risk model. <b>Results:</b> A total of 1628 critically sick HCC patients were enrolled. Among these, 23 (23.2%) patients at our hospital, 84 (17.9%) patients in the eICU-CRD database, and 379 (35.8%) patients in the MIMIC-IV database developed AKI. A unique risk model was developed based on leukocyte-related indicators following the multivariate logistic regression analysis, incorporating white blood cell to neutrophil ratio (WNR), white blood cell to monocyte ratio (WMR), white blood cell to hemoglobin ratio (WHR), and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR). This risk model exhibited robust predictive capability for AKI, in-hospital mortality, and ICU mortality across the training set, internal validation set, and external validation set. <b>Conclusion:</b> This risk model seems to have practical consequences as an innovative and accessible tool for forecasting the prognosis of critically ill HCC patients, which may, to some degree, aid in identifying equitable risk assessments and treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Selection of suitable candidates for intraoperative tumour detection and cytoreductive surgery (CRS) combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is important for improving outcomes for patients with colorectal peritoneal metastases. Previous research demonstrated the use of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), intraoperative radiodetection, and near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF)-guided surgery with a dual-labelled 111In-labelled dodecane tetra-acetic acid (DOTA)-labetuzumab-IRDye800CW tracer to detect peritoneal metastases before operation. The aim of this study was to validate these results. A single-centre phase II study was conducted to evaluate the safety and feasibility of 111In-labelled DOTA-labetuzumab-IRDye800CW in patients with colorectal peritoneal metastases undergoing CRS-HIPEC. SPECT/computed tomography (CT) was undertaken before surgery, after intravenous administration of 10\u2005mg 111In-labelled DOTA-labetuzumab-IRDye800CW (mean 101.25 MBq). During surgery, radiodetection and NIRF imaging were used for tumour detection. Adverse events were assessed, and tumour-to-background ratios (TBRs) and peritoneal cancer index scores were analysed. Seven patients were included. No study-related severe adverse events were reported. Imaging before surgery revealed previously undetected metastases in one patient. The mean(standard deviation, s.d.) SPECT/CT peritoneal cancer index score was 3(2), and the intraoperative score was 14(7) (P = 0.032). A total of 52 lesions were removed during CRS, of which 37 were malignant. With NIRF imaging, 34 (92%) of 37 malignant lesions were detectable. Of 52 fluorescent lesions, 4 were false-positive. Mean(s.d.) fluorescence TBR was 3.4(1.8) and mean radiodetection TBR was 4.4(1.4). This study confirmed the safety and feasibility of multimodal image-guided surgery in patients with peritoneal metastases.",

    "title": "Predictor-Based Output Feedback Control of Tumour Growth With Positive Input: Application to Antiangiogenic Therapy.",
    "abstract": "Controlling tumour growth systems presents significant challenges due to the inherent restriction of positive input in biological systems, along with delays in system output and input measurements. Traditional control methods struggle to address these issues effectively, as they rely heavily on real-time feedback from system outputs. The delays in output measurements can lead to instability in closed-loop systems, whereas the inability of conventional approaches to manage the positive input constraint often results in ineffective control. In this study, the authors propose a novel control system designed to overcome these challenges. First, a system state prediction observer that utilises delayed output measurements was developed. Next, a backstepping technique was utilized to develop a feedback controller that ensures the control input stays positive, thereby guaranteeing the system's asymptotic stability. Furthermore, numerical comparisons with previous research validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Overall, the approach offers a promising solution to the issues of delays and positive input constraints in tumour growth control systems.",

    "abstract": "Shikonin (SHK), extracted from the traditional Chinese herb <i>Lithospermum erythrorhizon</i>, demonstrates a wide range of pharmacological activities. This study aimed to explore the role and underlying mechanisms of the 5-methylcytosine (m<sup>5</sup>C) RNA methyltransferase NOL1/NOP2/SUN domain (NSUN)2 in acute myelocytic leukemia (AML). To assess cell viability and death, we employed Cell Counting Kit-8 and propidium iodide staining. Ferroptosis-related markers were evaluated using commercial kits and Western blot analysis. The m<sup>5</sup>C levels of ferroptosis-associated mRNAs were quantified by methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP)-qPCR. The specific m<sup>5</sup>C sites on the transferrin receptor (TFRC) mRNA were identified through a dual-luciferase reporter assay, while the interaction between NSUN2 and TFRC was investigated using RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP). The role of SHK <i>in vivo</i> was explored using a xenografted tumor model. Our findings revealed that SHK significantly reduced cell viability and induced cell death and ferroptosis in HL-60 and NB4 cells. Notably, SHK treatment led to an upregulation of NSUN2 expression. Inhibition of NSUN2 reversed the effects of SHK, restoring cell viability and reducing cell death and ferroptosis. Mechanistically, NSUN2 enhanced TFRC expression via m<sup>5</sup>C-dependent methylation. Overexpression of NSUN2 similarly decreased cell viability and increased cell death and ferroptosis, effects that were mitigated upon silencing of TFRC. <i>In vivo</i>, SHK treatment effectively suppressed tumor growth in xenografted mice. In summary, our study demonstrated that SHK promoted cell death and ferroptosis in AML by modulating NSUN2-mediated m<sup>5</sup>C methylation of TFRC. These findings provided novel insights into potential therapeutic strategies for AML.",

    "abstract": "Progesterone rapidly induces ovarian cancer cell death through non-genomic actions mediated by the membrane progesterone receptor (mPR). We investigated the combined effects of progesterone and SN38, an active metabolite of irinotecan, on ovarian cancer cells. mPR-positive and PR-negative ovarian cancer cell lines were utilized in experiments. Tumor cells were exposed to SN38 or cisplatin for 48\u2009h following exposure to progesterone for 30\u2009min. The viable cell counts were measured using a colorimetric assay and the expression of topoisomerase I (TOPO-I), the direct target of SN38, was observed with or without exposure to progesterone. Moreover, we investigated the relationship between several types of programmed cell death and the SN38 sensitivity enhancement effect of progesterone using specific cell death inhibitors. The chemosensitivity to SN38 was 8.7- to 26.0-fold higher with the administration of progesterone than that without (p\u2009<\u20090.01), but not to cisplatin in ovarian cancer cells. Progesterone suppressed the expression of TOPO-I mRNA by less than 50% (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Furthermore, among various programmed cell death inhibitors, only the ferroptosis inhibitor attenuated the progesterone-induced SN38 chemosensitivity enhancement effect. Progesterone increased sensitivity to SN38 by suppressing TOPO-I expression and inducing ferroptosis. The combination of progesterone and irinotecan could be a novel treatment modality for ovarian cancer.",

This study aims to assess the feasibility of implementing the World Health Organization's 2021\u00a0hPV-based screening guideline in Tanzania by identifying potential barriers and facilitators to HPV-based screening among screening clients, healthcare providers, and stakeholders. From October 2022 to February 2023, 25 semi-structured interviews were conducted with screening clients (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u200916) and healthcare providers and stakeholders (<i>n</i>\u2009=\u20099) in Moshi and Dar es Salaam. Data were analyzed using a deductive framework based on Bronfenbrenner's Social Ecological Model, supplemented with inductive subcategories from the transcripts. Barriers and facilitators emerged across all levels of the Social Ecological Model. At the individual level, clinic-based screening and a one-visit approach were barriers, while HPV-self-sampling was a facilitator. Interpersonal barriers included limited social support, while referrals served as facilitators. Community-level barriers included fear and misconceptions, countered by facilitators such as increased awareness and health education. Health system challenges included restrictive age limits and urbanization of human resources, with uptake through other health services acted as a facilitator. Political barriers highlighted the need for a steady local supply chain, while cost reduction could serve as a facilitator for guideline implementation. WHO's 2021\u00a0hPV-based screening guideline shows promise in Tanzania, but barriers such as clinic availability, fear, misconceptions, and supply chain issues must be addressed to ensure successful implementation.",

    "title": "Expression Significance and Prognostic Value of GPR27 in Ovarian Cancer.",
    "abstract": "This study explored the prognostic role of GPR27 and its predictive value to platinum-based therapy in ovarian cancer. A survival analysis of GPR27, and the therapeutic response to platinum in ovarian cancer was investigated using data from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. GPR27 expression was assessed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. Database analysis and RT-PCR revealed over-expression of GPR27 mRNA in ovarian cancer tissues compared to normal ovarian tissues. Ovarian cancer patients with up-regulated GPR27 transcription were associated with better overall survival and disease-free survival compared to those with downregulated GPR27 mRNA in the TCGA dataset and Kaplan-Meier plot database (<i>N</i>\u2009=\u20091656). GPR27 demonstrated good predictive value for pathological response in patients with ovarian cancer receiving platinum-based therapy. The predictive performance for 6-month relapse-free survival was higher in endometrioid ovarian cancer (AUC:0.804) than that in serous ovarian cancer. GPR27 protein levels were significantly up-regulated in ovarian cancer tissues compared with normal ovarian tissue, and high GPR27 protein expression correlated with early-stage TNM. ROC analysis revealed that the GPR27 protein, quantified by the immunohistochemistry score, effectively predicted the response to platinum-based therapy response with an AUC of 0.7479 in our cohort. GPR27 was up-regulated in ovarian cancer, compared with that of normal ovarian tissue, and was strongly correlated with survival outcomes and response to platinum-based therapy. GPR27 may serve as a reliable biomarker for platinum -based therapy in ovarian cancer patients.",

These hormonal imbalances lead to a diverse array of clinical manifestations. This case report describes a middle-aged male patient presenting with a dual-hormone secreting ACC, characterized by the secretion of both androgens and cortisol. This hormonal profile resulted in Cushing syndrome along with symptoms of androgen excess, including bilateral lower limb edema, prolonged fatigue, and altered mental status. An extensive diagnostic evaluation, including clinical assessments, laboratory tests and imaging revealed the presence of an adrenal mass and lung metastases. Imaging-guided biopsy confirmed diagnosis of ACC with simultaneous androgen and cortisol secretion. This report enriches the sparse literature on dual-secreting ACC, highlighting the complexities in its diagnosis and management.",

The mass required aspiration and hemithyroidectomy. The case demonstrates the efficacy of point-of-care ultrasonography (USG) and cyst aspiration as initial steps in the process of decompression. However, it is imperative to exercise caution and meticulous monitoring of the patient, as the necessity for urgent or elective surgical intervention remains a possibility. Furthermore, it is imperative to perform elective surgery, as histological examination of thyroid glands post-hemorrhage reveals malignancy in 5.1-66.7% of cases.",

    "title": "Drug Delivery System for Cancer Immunotherapy: Potential Roles, Challenge and Recent Advances.",
    "abstract": "Immunotherapy has emerged as a pivotal advancement in oncological therapeutics, representing a paradigm shift from conventional treatment modalities including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. This innovative approach demonstrates considerable clinical potential through its capacity to enhance systemic anti-tumor responses via active or passive immunomodulation. Compared to traditional therapies, immunotherapy offers distinct advantages such as broad applicability, rapid therapeutic onset, and reduced adverse effects. However, critical challenges persist in clinical implementation, particularly concerning treatment safety and efficacy optimization. Current limitations, including drug off-target effects and biological delivery barriers, frequently result in suboptimal therapeutic outcomes and severe complications such as autoimmune disorders and nonspecific inflammation. Recently advancements in drug delivery systems (DDS) present transformative solutions to these challenges. Sophisticated DDS platforms enable precise spatiotemporal delivery of tumor antigens, immunotherapeutic agents, and immunostimulatory molecules, thereby achieving targeted modulation of diverse immune cell populations. This technological innovation not only enhances therapeutic efficacy but also significantly mitigates adverse reactions, while facilitating synergistic combinations with conventional cancer treatments. In this review, we outline the application of new drug delivery platforms in major malignancies (including but not limited to melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma). We further propose evidence-based optimization strategies for next-generation delivery platforms, aiming to bridge the gap between preclinical development and clinical implementation in cancer immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "High-grade astrocytoma with piloid features (HGAP) is a recently described primary brain tumor and the first requiring a specific methylation pattern for diagnosis, as its histologic features are often compatible with other tumors such as glioblastoma (GBM). Characterized by molecular alterations in CDKN2A/B, NF1, BRAF, FGFR1, and ATRX, they may be located anywhere in the CNS but show a predilection for the posterior fossa. Reports are limited to retrospective case series, and the standard of care is not yet established. We performed a retrospective review of electronic medical records of all patients with HGAP at our institution. Records were queried for demographic, radiographic, clinical, surgical, pathologic, and outcome data. Eighteen patients were included with a median 17.1 months follow-up. Of these, 12 (63.2%) were women with a mean age of 43 years (range 24-67). The most common tumor locations were the cerebellum (8 patients, 42.1%) and thalamus (6 patients, 31.6%). On imaging, tumors were most commonly homogeneously contrast-enhancing (10 patients, 52.6%) or rim enhancing with central necrosis (5 patients, 26.3%). Ten patients (52.6%) underwent biopsy, while nine (47.4%) underwent resection, of which four (44.4%) underwent gross total resection. Adjuvant therapy included radiation in 16 patients (88.9%) and systemic treatment in 16 patients (88.9%). The initial systemic treatment was temozolomide in 14 patients (77.8%). One patient received upfront trametinib (a MEK1 inhibitor), and one patient received upfront dabrafenib (a BRAF inhibitor). At last follow up, 11 patients (57.9%) had progressive disease. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.4 months (range 1.6-28.2 months), and median overall survival (OS) had not been reached. HGAP is a newly described rare glial tumor without an established standard of care. Its aggressive behavior and targetable mutations warrant further investigation regarding predictors of outcome for this entity.",

    "abstract": "Omentum transplantation has emerged as a versatile and effective technique across various surgical disciplines due to its unique properties of immunological surveillance, anti-inflammatory effects, and wound healing promotion. In breast cancer surgeries, it has been utilized to manage locoregional issues and immediate reconstruction, providing satisfactory cosmetic outcomes and minimal complications, particularly in patients who had previously undergone irradiation. For esophageal cancer, omental reinforcement has significantly reduced anastomotic leak rates and postoperative complications, supporting its use in esophagectomy and complex cardiothoracic surgeries. In gynecological surgeries, the use of omental flaps has shown excellent results in neovaginal reconstruction following pelvic exenteration, offering distinct advantages over myocutaneous flaps by reducing morbidity and preserving sexual function. Additionally, omental transposition has proven beneficial in reducing surgical morbidity following radical abdominal hysterectomy and in managing vaginal cuff dehiscence through vaginal approaches. Robotic-assisted omental flap harvesting has enhanced precision and reduced complications in reconstructive surgeries, making it a promising minimally invasive approach in regenerative surgery and complex reconstructions, such as for facial skeleton reconstruction. The omentum has also been beneficial in laparoscopic procedures for pudendal nerve decompression and in managing thoracic aortic graft infections, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness in various clinical settings. These studies collectively highlight the omentum's significant role in improving surgical outcomes, reducing complications, and enhancing the quality of life for patients, solidifying its place as a valuable tool in modern surgical practice. This article provides a comprehensive narrative review of omentum transplantation in oncology, discussing its current applications and future potential as a standard treatment modality.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of prostate cancer (PCa) necessitates advanced diagnostic approaches for detection and lesion characterization. Utilizing two patient cohorts (n\u2009=\u200985), this study analyzes a custom-designed 3D ultrasonic acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elasticity imaging system alongside an Index of Suspicion (IOS) lesion ranking system to evaluate reader sensitivity, positive predictive values, inter-reader reliability, and ARFI-mpMRI concordance. The IOS system provides standardized criteria for lesion assessment, enabling consistency in stratifying PCa lesion suspicion. Three readers were trained on multiparametric ultrasound (mpUS) (combined ARFI and B-mode) prostate image volumes from 6 patients based on the IOS criteria. The readers then marked suspicious lesions in 79 patients who were retrospectively compared with histopathology-identified (Cohort I, post-radical prostatectomy) or biopsy-confirmed (Cohort II) cancerous regions. The IOS criteria stratified lesions by Gleason grade (GG), with a higher IOS correlating with more aggressive lesions. mpUS imaging was more sensitive for detecting lesions with higher GG and preferentially identified lesions with lower MR apparent-diffusion coefficients and signs of extraprostatic extension. mpUS imaging demonstrated substantial inter-reader reliability and moderate overlap with mpMRI lesions, with increasing sensitivity to higher MRI PI-RADS score lesions. mpUS imaging was less sensitive than mpMRI to lesions with lower GG. The increased sensitivity of mpUS imaging to higher GG lesions and adverse histopathological factors, along with moderate agreement with mpMRI, suggest that mpUS has the potential to guide biopsy targeting of mpMRI-visible lesions or serve as an alternative biopsy-targeting approach when mpMRI is unavailable or clinically contraindicated.",

    "abstract": "Body temperature plays an important role in cancer, with febrile temperature generally associated with improved cancer resistance. In murine models, this resistance has been linked to the cytotoxic T cells, whose differentiation into cancer-killing effector cells is poor at lower but robust at elevated temperatures. If conserved, temperature-mediated potentiation of patient-derived T cells could be implemented to improve the existing cancer treatments, including the chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR T-cell therapy). Here, we tested this possibility using human STEAP1 CAR-T cells developed to target prostate cancer. In mice, transient exposure to febrile temperature (39-40 \u00baC) increases the production of IFN-\u03b3 and the cancer-killing ability of CD8\u2009+\u2009T cells. Using a similar temperature treatment, we observed elevated levels of IFN-\u03b3 also in the human CAR-T cells. However, these cells displayed no improvement in their ability to kill cancer cells. Although we cannot discount the possibility that alternative protocols might lead to other outcomes, our findings suggest that incorporating thermal potentiation into existing protocols of CAR-T cell therapy may be more complicated than anticipated.",

    "title": "Neutrophil extracellular traps induced by neoadjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer promotes vascular endothelial damage.",
    "abstract": "The mechanisms underpinning neoadjuvant chemotherapy-induced vascular endothelial injury in breast cancer remain elusive. Our study aims to demonstrate that Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) play a pivotal role in neoadjuvant chemotherapy-induced vascular endothelial injury in breast cancer, elucidating that chemotherapy-induced upregulation of Solute Carrier 11a1 (Slc11a1) modulates Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generation, which may be critical for NETs formation. We investigated the impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer on NETs formation and vascular endothelial injury by analyzing NETs dsDNA and serum markers in patients, cells, and chemotherapy mouse models. RNA sequencing of neutrophils from chemotherapy mouse models was performed to identify the potential NETs formation-associated gene Slc11a1, which was further validated through cellular and animal experiments by assessing Slc11a1 expression, intracellular ferrous ion content, and ROS levels. Knockdown of Slc11a1 in human neutrophils and mouse models were also performed to further confirm the phenotypic results. Our study revealed that plasma NETs formation and endothelial injury markers were significantly elevated in breast cancer patients undergoing docetaxel & carboplatin (TCb) neoadjuvant chemotherapy, compared to controls. In these patients, NETs formation was associated with the augmentation of endothelial injury markers. Chemotherapy mouse models demonstrated that TCb treatment markedly elevated NETs formation and endothelial injury, which can be mitigated by CI-amidine, a protein-arginine deiminase inhibitor. In human neutrophils, we demonstrated that the TCb chemotherapeutic agents (combination of docetaxel and carboplatin) induced the formation of NETs, which subsequently facilitated damage to human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro. RNA sequencing of mouse neutrophils identified Slc11a1 as a key NETs formation-related gene, which was upregulated by TCb chemotherapy in neutrophils, leading to increased intracellular ferrous ion content and ROS generation. Knockdown of Slc11a1 in human neutrophils and mouse models demonstrated its reversal effect on TCb-induced ferrous ion upregulation, ROS generation, and NETs formation. Our research underscores the capacity of TCb neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer to augment NETs formation in neutrophils through Slc11a1-mediated ROS generation, which is linked to vascular endothelial injury. Our study elucidates the potential mechanisms underlying perioperative vascular endothelial injury in breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, offering novel insights into perioperative therapeutic management strategies for these patients.",

    "abstract": "Streamlining the clinical procedure of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) examination is challenging. Previous studies neglected the intra-class variability within both HER2-positive and -negative groups and lacked multi-cohort validation. To address this deficiency, this study collected data from multiple cohorts to develop a robust model for HER2 scoring utilizing only Hematoxylin&Eosin-stained whole slide images (WSIs). A total of 578 WSIs were collected from five cohorts, including three public and two private datasets. Each WSI underwent adaptive scale cropping. The transfer-learning-based probabilistic aggregation (TL-PA) model and multi-instance learning (MIL)-based models were compared, both of which were trained on Cohort A and validated on Cohorts B-D. The model demonstrating superior performance was further evaluated in the neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) cohort. Scoring performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Correlation between the model scores and specific grades (HER2 levels, pathological complete response (pCR) status, residual cancer burden (RCB) grades) were evaluated using Spearman rank correlation and Dunn's test. Patch analysis was performed with manually defined features. For HER2 scoring, the TL-PA significantly outperformed the MIL-based models, achieving robust AUCs in four validation cohorts (Cohort A: 0.75, Cohort B: 0.75, Cohort C: 0.77, Cohort D: 0.77). Correlation analysis confirmed a moderate association between model scores and manual reader-defined HER2-IHC status (Coefficient<sub>(Spearman)</sub>\u2009=\u20090.37, P<sub>(Spearman)</sub>\u2009=\u20090.001) as well as RCB grades (Coefficient<sub>(Spearman)</sub>\u2009=\u20090.45, P<sub>(Spearman)</sub>\u2009=\u20090.0006). In Cohort NAT, with the non-pCR as the positive control, the AUC was 0.77. Patch analysis revealed a core-to-peritumoral probability decrease pattern as malignancy spread outward from the lesion's core. TL-PA shows robust generalization for HER2 scoring with minimal data; however, it still inadequately capture intra-class variability. This indicates that future deep-learning endeavors should incorporate more detailed annotations to better align the model's focus with the reasoning of pathologists.",

    "abstract": "Meningiomas exhibit a complex biology that, despite notable successes in preclinical studies, contributes to the failures of pharmaceutical clinical trials. Animal models using patient tumor cells closely mimic in vivo conditions but are labor-intensive, costly, and unsuitable for high-throughput pharmaceutical testing. In comparison, monolayer cell models (two-dimensional, 2D) are cost-efficient but lack primary tumor cell-cell interactions, potentially overestimating treatment effects. Three-dimensional (3D) models offer an alternative through more precise mimicking of tumor morphology and physiology than 2D models and are less costly than in vivo methods. Here, we aimed to establish a 3D cell model in a solid xeno-free medium using patient-derived tumors, thus creating a bench-to-clinic pathway for personalized pharmaceutical testing. Four WHO grade 1 and one WHO grade 2 (third-passage, fresh) and 12 WHO grade 1 patient-derived meningioma cells (sixth-passage, frozen) and the malignant IOMM-Lee cell line were used to establish 2D and 3D models. The 3D model was developed using a solid xeno-free medium. After 3 months for the primary tumor and 13 days for the IOMM-Lee cell line, the 3D models were extracted and assessed using histology, immunohistochemistry, and epigenetic analyses (EPICv2 array) on five pairs to evaluate their structural fidelity, cellular composition, and epigenetic landscape compared to the original tumor. None of the frozen samples successfully generated 3D models. Models from fresh meningioma samples were more immunohistochemically similar to the primary tumors compared to 2D models, particularly regarding proliferation. 3D models displayed loss of fibrous tissue. All 3D models had similar copy number variation profiles, visually. Genome-wide DNA methylation level patterns were similar between pairs of 3D models and primary tumors. Correlation plots between CpG methylation levels showed high congruency between primary meningiomas and their corresponding 3D models for all samples (R\u2009>\u20090.95). Our patient-derived 3D meningioma models closely mimicked primary tumors in terms of cell morphology, immunohistochemical markers and genome-wide DNA methylation patterns, providing a cost-effective and accessible alternative to in vivo models. This approach has the potential to facilitate personalized treatment strategies for patients requiring additional therapy beyond surgery.",

    "abstract": "Extramedullary disease (EMD) in multiple myeloma (MM) represents a significant clinical challenge, with a limited understanding of the spatial architecture and its pathobiological impact. To address this unmet need, we examined 10 matched samples from bone marrow (BM) and cognate EMD sites. This investigation provides critical insights into the distinct features of EMD, offering potential avenues for more effective diagnosis and targeted therapies. To this aim, we employed MACSima\u2122 Imaging Cyclic Staining (MICS) to unveil distinct biomarker expression profiles as companion diagnostics for a personalized therapeutic approach for MM. We observed elevated BCL-2 levels in EMD plasma cells (p\u2009<\u20090.0001), indicating the potential of BCL-2 inhibitors to target anti-apoptotic pathways in select cases. The higher expression of EZH2 in EMD compared to BM (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) highlights its role in sustaining aggressive tumor phenotypes and supports the use of epigenetic-targeting agents in key situations. In contrast, CD3\u2009+\u2009T-cell distance was significantly higher in EMD, reflecting impaired immune surveillance (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Across the cohort, our analysis revealed significant differences between BM and EMD regarding the expression and spatial organization of key markers. CD38 expression was markedly reduced in EMD plasma cells (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). These findings underscore profound biological heterogeneity in MM and its BM emancipated disease phenotype, emphasizing dysfunctional apoptosis, immune evasion and resistance to CD38-targeting therapies in EMD, conceivably informing future validations. By integrating high-dimensional data, this study provides insights into potential druggable vulnerabilities for crafted interventions, particularly challenging in EMD cases.",

    "title": "Exploration of risk factors for the occurrence and recurrence of papillary thyroid carcinoma with Hashimoto's thyroiditis based on next-generation sequencing.",
    "abstract": "To investigate the risk factors for the occurrence and recurrence of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) combined with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). A total of 249 patients who underwent thyroid cancer surgery at the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University from October 2020 to December 2020 were included in this study. They were divided into two groups: HT and non-HT (NHT) groups based on whether they were diagnosed with HT or not. Clinical data, NGS results, and 4-year follow-up recurrence were collected and analyzed using binary logistic regression and COX regression analysis to identify factors influencing the occurrence and recurrence of PTC with HT. Patients in the HT group had a higher percentage of low age, multifocality, high TgAb, and RET rearrangement compared to the NHT group. However, they had a lower rate of extrathyroidal extension (ETE), lymph node metastasis (LNM), and BRAF mutation (P < 0.05). Among patients with RET rearrangement in the HT group, there was a higher rate of LNM and recurrence (P < 0.05). Patients with BRAF mutation in the HT group were more likely to be male and have multifocal tumors (P < 0.05). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that multifocality, RET rearrangement, low age, and lymph node negativity were risk factors for HT combined with PTC. Univariate COX analysis revealed that multifocality, LNM, ETE, recurrence risk stratification, TSH, RET rearrangement, and the interaction between RET rearrangement and Hashimoto's effect were risk factors for recurrence after PTC. Multifactorial COX regression analysis showed that ETE and recurrence risk stratification were risk factors for recurrence after PTC surgery. Multifocality, high TgAb, low age, and lymph node negativity can assist in the preoperative diagnosis of HT combined with PTC. BRAF mutations are less common in HT combined with PTC but do not significantly affect recurrence. Patients with RET rearrangement in addition to HT have a higher risk of recurrence, and special attention should be paid to intraoperative clearance in these patients.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer remains one of the most common cancers in women worldwide. Early detection is critical for improving patient outcomes, yet current screening methods have limitations. Therefore, there is a pressing need for more sensitive and specific approaches to detect breast cancer in its earliest stages. Liquid biopsy has emerged as a promising non-invasive method for early cancer detection and management. DNA methylation, an epigenetic alteration that often precedes genetic changes, has been observed in precancerous or early cancer stages, making it a valuable biomarker. This review explores the role of DNA methylation in breast cancer and its potential for developing blood-based tests. We discuss advancements in DNA methylation detection methods, recent discoveries of potential DNA methylation biomarkers from both single-omics and multi-omics integration studies, and the role of machine learning in enhancing diagnostic accuracy. Challenges and future directions are also addressed. Although challenges remain, advances in multi-omics integration and machine learning continue to enhance the clinical potential of methylation-based biomarkers. Ongoing research is crucial to further refine these approaches and improve early detection and patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Drug resistance is one of the main reasons for cancer treatment failure, leading to a rapid recurrence/disease progression of the cancer. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has empowered physicians to use its powerful data processing and pattern recognition capabilities to extract and mine valuable drug resistance information from large amounts of clinical or omics data, to study drug resistance mechanisms, to evaluate and predict drug resistance, and to develop innovative therapeutic strategies to reduce drug resistance. In this review, we proposed a feasible workflow for incorporating AI into tumor drug resistance research, highlighted current AI-driven tumor drug resistance applications, and discussed the opportunities and challenges encountered in the process. Based on a comprehensive literature analysis, we systematically summarized the role of AI in tumor drug resistance research, including drug development, resistance mechanism elucidation, drug sensitivity prediction, combination therapy optimization, resistance phenotype identification, and clinical biomarker discovery. With the continuous advancement of AI technology and rigorous validation of clinical data, AI models are expected to fuel the development of precision oncology by improving efficacy, guiding therapeutic decisions, and optimizing patient prognosis. In summary, by leveraging clinical and omics data, AI models are expected to pioneer new therapy strategies to mitigate tumor drug resistance, improve efficacy and patient survival, and provide novel perspectives and tools for oncology treatment.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer (OC) is among the most lethal gynecologic malignancies, characterized by poor prognosis. While aging is a well-established risk factor, the underlying mechanisms distinguishing early- and late-onset ovarian cancer remain poorly understood. This study analyzed the global burden and age-related trends of ovarian cancer using the GBD database. A cut-off age of 55\u00a0years was used to differentiate between early and late onset ovarian cancer, and a Mendelian randomization method was also used to investigate the causal relationship between aging and ovarian cancer. Machine learning was applied to identify tumor-specific age-associated genes, followed by bioinformatics analyses and single-cell sequencing to explore the roles of these genes and immune profile alterations in ovarian cancer. Additionally, models were constructed, and drug sensitivity analyses performed to evaluate their potential as diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets. Ovarian cancer incidence and mortality exhibit age-related trends, with telomere length positively associated with increased risk (OR\u2009=\u20091.27, 95% CI: 1.01-1.60, P\u2009=\u20093.90\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u207b<sup>2</sup>). Older patients with OC have a worse prognosis. PRKCD and UCP2 were significantly upregulated in ovarian cancer. PRKCD facilitates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), contributing to ovarian cancer progression, while UCP2 modulates ROS dynamics, influencing chemoresistance. Immune microenvironment analysis revealed differences between high- and low-expression groups, particularly in T cells, macrophages, and other immune cells. Both genes are sensitive to a varity of drugs, including dasatinib, fluvastatin, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets. Aging is a significant risk factor for ovarian cancer, with PRKCD and UCP2 closely linked to its onset and progression. These genes show promise as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for ovarian cancer.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma represents the most prevalent and deadly form of brain tumor with limited therapeutic drugs. The existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) hinders drugs permeate to the brain efficiently. Nowadays, nano-formulations, particularly carbon dots, have emerged as promising candidates for targeting and treating brain diseases. In this study, we report the synthesis of a novel carbon dots, PTX-CDs, using a one-step hydrothermal method with paclitaxel (PTX) as the precursor. PTX-CDs shows increased water solubility by about 1000 times in comparison with PTX. Moreover, PTX-CDs effectively penetrates the BBB and exerts significant anticancer effects. In detail, PTX-CDs accumulates in mitochondria of tumor cells without adding extra targeted molecules, resulting in the damage of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. Transcriptome profiling revealed that PTX-CDs disturbs the cell-cycle by inducing arrest at the G2/M phase, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation. PTX-CDs further decreased cell invasion by inhibiting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in glioblastoma cells. PTX-CDs significantly inhibited the growth of intracranial tumors in orthotopic glioblastoma mice model and prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice. This study presents a viable strategy to develop CDs-based therapeutic agent for glioblastoma using the conventional chemotherapeutic drugs.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in nodal staging for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) have prompted radiotherapy de-escalation trials to reduce irradiation of electively treated neck regions, with the goal of improving treatment tolerability. While volumetric de-escalation has shown promise in definitive radiotherapy of HNSCC, limited data exist regarding its safety in the postoperative treatment setting. This study aimed to assess dose-level-specific locoregional recurrence patterns following standard postoperative (chemo)radiotherapy in a mixed HNSCC cohort to inform risk-adaptive radiotherapy strategies. We retrospectively reviewed 203 HNSCC patients (75% HPV-negative, 25% HPV-positive) treated with curative intent postoperative (chemo)radiotherapy from 2017 to 2021. Recurrence imaging was co-registered with planning CT, and recurrent tumor volumes were dosimetrically compared to the target volume dose and spatially analyzed using a center-of-mass-based approach. We classified five recurrence types: A (central high-dose), B (peripheral high-dose), C (central intermediate- or low-dose), D (peripheral intermediate- or low-dose), and E (extraneous dose). With a median follow-up of 39.7 months, the three-year local, regional, and distant control of HPV-negative HNSCC were 84%, 87%, and 87%, respectively. Of 56 recurrences, 17 were local, 13 regional, 3 locoregional, 9 combined local/regional with concomitant distant failure, and 14 distant only. Of 40 analyzed recurrences, we identified 47.5% as type A/B, 5% as type C/D intermediate-dose, and 20% as type E, half of which were secondary cancers. Among the 27.5% (11/40) type C/D low-dose recurrences in the elective target volume, 15% (6/40) were true nodal failures, resulting in an overall elective neck failure rate of 3% (6/203). The predominance of high-dose recurrences suggests that biological tumor resistance is a key driver of treatment failure, highlighting the necessity to refine postoperative risk stratification and integrate tumor biology into dose escalation decisions. The low incidence of isolated nodal recurrences in electively treated neck regions supports the feasibility of volumetric de-escalation of postoperative radiotherapy. This approach might not only be feasible for HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancers but also for HPV-negative tumors, provided that accurate nodal staging has been conducted.",

Although the 5-year survival rate is approximately 70-80%, the current standard treatment results in severe and long-term side effects. The search for new anticancer immunotherapeutic targets has identified B7-H3 as a promising candidate in various solid tumors. However, the role of B7-H3 in MB remains unclear, and studies reporting its protein expression and association with clinicopathological characteristics are still limited. In this study, B7-H3 protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in seven non-tumor samples and 43 molecularly characterized MB tissues. Its expression profile was correlated with B7-H3 (CD276) mRNA levels, which were previously determined by nCounter, as well as with the patients' clinical features. Only 14.3% (1/7) of non-tumor brain and cerebellum tissues showed B7-H3 positivity, whereas 95.6% (41/43) of the MB samples expressed this protein at distinct levels. B7-H3 was found in the cytoplasm and on the membrane of cancer cells. A significant positive correlation was observed between CD276 mRNA and B7-H3 protein levels. Moreover, high expression of B7-H3 protein was associated with worse overall survival and the presence of metastasis at diagnosis. This is the first study to associate CD276 mRNA and B7-H3 protein levels in MB, revealing a significant positive correlation. We observed that B7-H3 was overexpressed in MB compared to non-tumor brain tissue. High B7-H3 expression was associated with a worse outcome and with the presence of metastasis at diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the leading cause for cancer mortality across the world. GRPEL2 is a critical regulator of mitochondria's function with an oncogenic role in different kinds of cancer. The exact function of GRPEL2 -driven mitochondrial regulation and CRC progression have not been elucidated. RNA-seq data from TCGA database was analyzed to identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets of CRC. The gene expression profile was validated by quantitative real-time PCR on 68 paired tumor and non-tumor samples from CRC patients. Tumorigenesis regulated by GRPEL2 was tested through EdU staining, Transwell assay, in vivo tumor growth and in vivo metastasis. The function of Mitochondria mediated by GRPEL2 was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy, DCFH-DA staining, mitochondrial membrane potential detection, and Calcein staining. LC-MS/MS screening and Co-IP were performed to discover protein partners of GRPEL2. E2F8-mediated transcriptional regulation of GRPEL2 was verified via Luciferase reporter and ChIP assays. GRPEL2 was upregulated in CRC tumor tissues and cell lines. High expression of GRPEL2 was associated with poor prognosis of CRC and inhibition of GRPEL2 suppressed CRC proliferation and migration by inducing mitochondria injury. Meanwhile, TIGAR was shown to interact with GRPEL2 and overexpression of TIGAR rescued CRC progression in the presence of GRPEL2 inhibition. Moreover, E2F8 was the upstream regulator of GRPEL2, which positively induced GRPEL2 transcription and expression in CRC. Our work illustrated the oncogenic role of GRPEL2 in CRC development and determined the molecular mechanism of E2F8/GRPEL2/TIGAR pathway. These findings will provide novel insights and promising therapeutic targets for CRC treatment in the future.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to explore the effect of LIM domain and actin binding 1 (LIMA1) on bladder cancer (BCa) cells and to investigate its underlying molecular mechanisms. The expression of LIMA1 gene in clinical BCa tissue samples and BCa cell models was detected using real-time quantitative PCR and western blot. Subsequently, LIMA1 knockdown experiments were performed exclusively in the BCa J82 cell line, while LIMA1 overexpression was conducted only in the cisplatin-resistant J82/CR cell line. The proliferation of the cells was assessed by colony formation assay. Cisplatin resistance was evaluated by MTT assay. Migration and invasion of the cells were tested by Transwell assay. Additionally, the levels of key proteins in the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway were examined by western blotting. We found that LIMA1 was underexpressed in BCa tissues and cells (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Overexpression of LIMA1 inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of BCa cells (P\u2009<\u20090.01) and improved their cisplatin resistance (P\u2009<\u20090.01), whereas knocking down LIMA1 produced opposite results (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Furthermore, overexpression of LIMA1 could suppress the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in BCa cells (P\u2009<\u20090.01), and activation of this pathway partially reversed the anti-tumor effects produced by overexpression of LIMA1 (P\u2009<\u20090.01). LIMA1 could inhibit the malignant biological behavior of BCa cells and weaken their cisplatin resistance by negatively regulating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. Our findings provide new insights for the clinical treatment of BCa.",

    "abstract": "Ewing sarcoma (ES) is the second most frequent sarcoma of bone, often affecting young patients and pursuing an aggressive clinical course. Among therapeutic choices, radio- and chemotherapy are employed in neoadjuvant setting, and they yield variable histological changes in neoplastic tissue, which mainly include necrosis and fibrosis. Cytodifferentiation is seldom observed in pediatric tumors such as nephroblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma following treatment. Nevertheless, it represents an extremely rare phenomenon in ES. In this study we present the clinico-pathologic and molecular features of two cases of ES undergoing neuroblastoma-like differentiation after treatment. Both tumors were primarily located in bone and presented the histologic and immunohistochemical features of classic ES in needle biopsies. They were treated with standard chemotherapy protocols followed by surgical resection. The resection specimens of the primary tumor of patient 1 and pleural metastases of patient 2 presented foci of eosinophilic fibrillary stroma resembling neuropil and containing cellular elements with wide granular eosinophilic cytoplasm, eccentric nuclei containing vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli, reminiscent of ganglion cells. These cells were positive for chromogranin, synaptophysin and CD56, while CD99 was negative. Molecular confirmation of EWSR1 rearrangement was provided in both cases by next generation sequencing and FISH analysis. Evidence of neural differentiation in ES unravels interesting hints about its controversial histogenesis. Furthermore, awareness of this event must be increased to avoid misdiagnosis with neuroblastoma, which shows significant morphological overlap.",

We analyzed genomic and transcriptomic data from pretreatment tumor samples of 342 melanoma patients treated with ICIs to identify mutations and expression signatures associated with ICI response and survival. External validation and mechanistic exploratory analyses were conducted in two additional datasets to assess generalizability. Responders were more likely to have received anti-PD-1 therapy rather than anti-CTLA-4 and exhibited a higher tumor mutation burden (both P\u2009<\u20090.001). Mutations in the dynein axonemal heavy chain (DNAH) family genes, specifically DNAH2 (P\u2009=\u20090.03), DNAH6 (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and DNAH9 (P\u2009<\u20090.01), were enriched in responders. The combined mutational status of DNAH 2/6/9 effectively stratified patients by progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51-0.92; P\u2009=\u20090.013) and overall survival (HR: 0.58; 95% CI 0.43-0.78; P\u2009<\u20090.001), with consistent association observed in the validation cohort (HR: 0.28; 95% CI 0.12-0.61; P\u2009<\u20090.001). DNAH-altered melanomas exhibited upregulation of chemokine signaling, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, and cell cycle-related pathways, along with elevated expression of immune-related signatures in interferon signaling, cytolytic activity, T cell function, and immune checkpoints. Using LASSO logistic regression, we identified a 26-gene composite signature predictive of clinical response, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.880 (95% CI 0.825-0.936) in the training dataset and 0.725 (95% CI 0.595-0.856) in the testing dataset.

    "abstract": "Cancer, a chronic and dangerous disease, poses a major public health burden. Inflammation and insulin resistance promote tumorigenesis. However, the temporal relationship between the two and their relationship with cancer risk must be elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the association between chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, and the propensity for cancer incidence. We explored the temporal relationship between triglyceride index (TyG) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels using cross-lagged modeling. We used COX proportional risk regression modeling to explore the association between high cumulative triglyceride and glucose index (CumTyG) and high cumulative high-sensitivity C-reactive Protein (CumhsCRP) and cancer risk. We further stratified CumTyG according to tertiles to explore the association of CumhsCRP with cancer risk at different insulin resistance levels and vice versa. We analyzed the association of combined chronic inflammation with insulin resistance, risk of different cancer types, and all-cause mortality. Finally, we performed two sensitivity analyses, excluding patients who developed cancer within the first year of follow-up and those with hsCRP levels\u2009>\u200910\u00a0mg/L. The results of the study showed that the standardized correlation coefficient (\u03b21) between hsCRP_2006/2007 and TyG_2010/2011 was 0.02306, which was significantly higher than the correlation (\u03b22) between TyG_2006/2007 and hsCRP_2010/2011, suggesting that inflammation played a more prominent role in future changes in insulin resistance. Chronic inflammation and insulin resistance are positively and synergistically associated with cancer risk, with high chronic inflammation and high insulin levels increasing the risk of carcinogenesis by 71%. Although CumTyG in different CumhsCRP strata and CumhsCRP in different CumTyG strata promoted carcinogenesis, there were differences in the extent of carcinogenesis. High inflammation and insulin resistance, which promote cancer onset, are closely associated with digestive system cancers. The sensitivity analysis was consistent with the primary results and verified their reliability. This study revealed the potential impact of inflammation on future changes in insulin resistance.

    "abstract": "Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (NASH-HCC) accounts for an increasing proportion of HCC cases. Currently, effective pharmacological options for treating both NASH and NASH-HCC remain limited, necessitating the identification of novel therapeutic agents. Our previous studies have demonstrated that ginger can ameliorate nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and prevent the occurrence of NASH. The therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of NASH-HCC, however, remain poorly understood. Network pharmacology, bioinformatics, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, and molecular docking were used to identify the main active compounds, targets, and possible mechanisms of ginger in treating NASH-HCC. The anti-tumor efficacy and underlying mechanisms of the selected compound in treating NASH-HCC were validated through in vitro experimentation. Network pharmacology, bioinformatics, and molecular docking have revealed that 6-gingerol is the main active compound of ginger in treating NASH-HCC. SRC can be an essential target gene for ginger attenuating NASH-HCC progression, while the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and reactive oxygen species (ROS) play equally important roles. Single-cell RNA sequencing of the HCC patients shows that the key targets of ginger in treating NASH-HCC are distributed in tumor-associated macrophage (TAMs). It has been reported that NOX2-derived ROS in macrophages can activate Src and then regulate downstream MAPK signaling cascades. 6-Gingerol can inhibit the proliferation, migration and reduce lipid deposition of liver cancer cells in vitro. More importantly, it induces polarization TAMs to M1 and enhances proinflammatory function, which may be achieved via the NOX2/Src/MAPK signaling pathway. This study proves that 6-gingerol, the primary active compound in ginger, plays a role in attenuating the progression of NASH-HCC by inhibiting the proliferation and migration of tumor cells, or reprogramming TAMs to the M1 phenotype via the NOX2/Src/MAPK signaling pathway and activating the TAM-mediated\u00a0immune\u00a0responses.",

    "title": "Hsa-miR-21 promoted the progression of lung adenocarcinoma by regulating LRIG1 expression.",
    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the foremost cause of cancer-related fatalities globally, and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is one of the common types of lung cancer with significant molecular heterogeneity. Leucine rich repeats and immunoglobulin like domains 1 (LRIG1) has been demonstrated to be down-regulated in lung cancer and related to prognosis of patients. The purpose of this work is to explore the targeting miRNAs of LRIG1, and the related regulatory mechanisms in LUAD. The data of LUAD patients were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases. The differential expression analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were performed using \"limma\" and \"clusterProfiler\" function package, respectively. The levels of hsa-miR-21 mRNA and LRIG1 mRNA and LRIG1 protein expressions were analyzed using RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. The infiltration of immune cells was determined using CIBERSORT software. In LUAD patients, hsa-miR-21 expression was observably related to LRIG1 expression. Hsa-miR-21 might negatively modulate the LRIG1 expression in LUAD. LUAD patients with hsa-miR-21 up-regulation exhibited inferior prognosis. In addition, those with LUAD who had high hsa-miR-21 expression but low LRIG1 expression had a worse prognosis, whereas those with low hsa-miR-21 expression but high LRIG1 expression had a better prognosis. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that metabolic related signaling pathways (EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance) were significantly activated in LUAD patients with LRIG1 up-regulation. Finally, we found that relative content of naive B cells, plasma cells and resting CD4\u2009+\u2009T cells were significantly increased and regulatory T cells and Macrophages M0 were decreased in LRIG1 high expression group and hsa-miR-21 low expression group. We firstly reported that hsa-miR-21 might regulate the LRIG1 expression in LUAD, thereby effecting the onset and progression of LUAD. Clinical trial number: Not applicable.",

    "title": "Relationships of triglyceride-glucose-related indices with colorectal cancer incidence and mortality in an American population: a dose-response meta-analysis and cohort study.",
    "abstract": "The degree to which the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index might interact with colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality is undefined. This systematic analysis was conducted through meta-analyses and large-scale databases. A meta-analysis was conducted through database search up to April 1, 2025, and articles investigating the incidence of CRC with clearly reported TyG index values, focusing on their dose-response relationship, were included. To validate the findings, data from the 1999-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were utilized to explore links of TyG levels with CRC-linked mortality. Analyses involving restricted cubic splines (RCSs), weighted logistic regression (WLR), and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were performed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses explored predictive potential. Subgroup evaluation was subsequently conducted for detecting the susceptible populations. Multivariate logistic regression showcased a greater CRC incidence among individuals in quartiles two, three, and four of TyG and TyG-body mass index (TyG-BMI) (95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.14-1.5, 1.07-1.45; 1.39-1.83, 1.11-1.64; and 1.60-2.12, 1.19-1.93, respectively; P\u2009<\u20090.001). In contrast, multivariate Cox regression indicated a significant increase in CRC-related mortality only in the second quartile of TyG (95% CI: 1.22-7.47; P\u2009<\u20090.05). Analysis of the RCS curves demonstrated that the incidence of CRC displayed a nonlinear association with TyG (P\u2009=\u20090.045 for nonlinearity) but a positive linear association with TyG-BMI (P\u2009=\u20090.385 for nonlinearity). The TyG and associated indices did not exhibit any obvious dose-response association with CRC-related mortality (P\u2009>\u20090.05). ROC analyses exploring CRC risk revealed that TyG-BMI outperformed all indicators (area under the curve (AUC)\u2009=\u20090.71). Subgroup analysis revealed statistically significant links of CRC incidence with both TyG-BMI and female sex. TyG and TyG-BMI may function as dependable markers for predicting CRC likelihood, and TyG-BMI outperformed all other predictors considered herein. However, TyG and associated indices showed no significant interrelationships with the mortality of CRC.",

    "title": "Effects of art therapy on psychological outcomes among children and adolescents with cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "The increasingly rising incidence of cancer among children and adolescents has led to notable psychological challenges for this population. Art therapy, classified within the realm of complementary and alternative medicine interventions and psychotherapy, demonstrates promising potential psychological benefits for children and adolescents. Therefore, a systematic review was conducted to determine the effects of art therapy on improving psychological outcomes among patients with pediatric cancer and identify the details of art therapy. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. Ten English language databases, two Chinese databases, and grey literature were searched. Two researchers independently conducted study selection, quality assessment and data extraction. The Generic inverse variance method with random-effects models was applied to do meta-analysis. Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and five quasi-experimental studies with acceptable quality involving 452 participants from five countries were included. Our meta-analysis revealed statistically significant improvement in anxiety, depression among pediatric cancer patients. Narrative findings suggested art therapy could improve the overall psychological symptoms, stress, and anger. Art therapy can positively improve psychological outcomes, particularly anxiety and depression. However, the evidence is weakened by limited studies and methodological heterogeneity. Additional high-quality RCTs with large samples are warranted to confirm and supplement the existing evidence. This review was registered in PROSPERO with ID CRD42023477700 on 11 November 2023.",

    "abstract": "To compare local tumor progression (LTP) and overall survival (OS) after image-guided thermal ablation (IGTA; microwave/radiofrequency ablation) versus stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with pulmonary metastases. A systematic literature review was performed to capture studies that used IGTA or SBRT for patients with pulmonary metastases and studies that reported one, two, and threeyear LTP/OS were included. Patients with pulmonary metastases, and a subgroup with metastases from colorectal or renal cell carcinoma, or sarcoma (termed subgroup) which are considered more radioresistant, were analyzed. Single-arm pooled analyses, univariable, and multivariable random-effects meta-regressions were conducted to compare LTP and OS between IGTA and SBRT treated patients. Analyses included 3,264 IGTA and 5,486 SBRT patients. IGTA patients with pulmonary metastases had higher LTP than SBRT patients at one year, 13% and 9% respectively. At two years, the LTP for IGTA patients was 14% compared to 16% for SBRT patients. Three-year LTP remained lower for IGTA patients compared to SBRT patients (14% and 22% respectively). In the subgroup, SBRT patients had higher LTP than IGTA patients across all timepoints. OS was similar across analyses/subgroups in the single-arm pooled analyses. The multivariable analyses showed that SBRT was associated with significantly lower OS at one year; however nonsignificant differences were observed at years two and three. In patients with pulmonary metastases, IGTA had lower LTP than SBRT at later timepoints. In patients with colorectal, renal cell carcinoma, or sarcoma pulmonary metastases, LTP was similar to overall LTP for IGTA, while it was higher for SBRT.",

    "title": "Bidirectional relationship between anxiety disorder and cancer: a longitudinal population-based cohort study.",
    "abstract": "Although research has highlighted the link between anxiety and cancer, studies on the relationship between the two have produced inconsistent findings. Therefore, we investigated this relationship and also examined which types of cancer are more likely to induce anxiety. This retrospective longitudinal cohort study, conducted in Taiwan from 2003 to 2016, looked at the risk of cancer in 23,255 patients with anxiety disorder and the risk of anxiety in 33,334 patients with cancer diagnosed between 2003 and 2005. For both analyses, a comparison cohort was created using 1:4 case-control sampling. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to analyze factors related to anxiety disorder or cancer. Patients with anxiety were more likely to develop cancer (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR]\u2009=\u20091.29; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.23-1.35) compared to those in the comparison group. Particularly high risks were observed for thyroid cancer (AHR: 2.13, CI: 1.60-2.82), skin cancer (AHR: 2.10, CI: 1.63-2.71), and prostate cancer (AHR: 1.97, CI: 1.59-2.47). Patients with cancer were more likely to develop anxiety than those without cancer (AHR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.56-1.71), with particularly high risks observed in those with nose cancer (AHR: 3.12, 95% CI: 2.41-4.03), leukemia (AHR: 2.54, 95% CI: 1.63-3.96), thyroid cancer (AHR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.84-2.97), and oral cancer (AHR: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.65-2.52). Our findings highlight a bidirectional link between cancer and anxiety disorder. Understanding this two-way connection can help healthcare providers develop effective strategies for managing cancer and anxiety disorders.",

    "abstract": "Chest pain is a common symptom with a complex etiology involving multiple organs and systems. Cardiovascular, digestive and respiratory diseases can cause chest pain. A single condition usually reformulates and can cause this symptom, but a combination of conditions can also cause it. This case reports a 69-year-old male suffered from recurrent chest pain. Coronary heart disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease and left lung adenocarcinoma were diagnosed successively for nearly 1 year. The patients focus on one disease, and the medical staff neglects to deal with multiple diseases simultaneously. Ambiguous evidence and patients' unmotivated attitudes towards treatment make early diagnosis of lung cancer difficult. Treatment for coronary heart disease and gastroesophageal reflux disease masks the symptoms of lung cancer to some extent, resulting in a skewed diagnostic focus. This report highlights the need for clinicians to improve communication with patients to enhance treatment adherence and provide comprehensive screening, identification, and treatment of chest pain etiologies to prevent delays in patient treatment. The findings also suggest that awareness of the therapeutic and prognostic impact of interstitial lung disease on lung cancer should be improved, which is essential for the development of clinical treatment protocols.",

    "title": "Primary and postoperative radiotherapy in acute neurological symptoms due to malignant spinal compression: retrospective analysis from a German university hospital.",
    "abstract": "Malignant spinal cord compression (MSCC) can lead to immediate neurological impairment. In order to preserve and, optimally, restore neurological functions, urgent treatment (usually, within 24\u00a0h) is necessary. Treatment options mainly consist of decompressive surgery (DS) and / or radiotherapy (RT) combined with steroids. Whereas historically, RT was the treatment of choice, DS has become standard of care, where applicable. Despite a variety of excellent studies, real world data of treatment in a large academic center is currently underrepresented. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients treated for MSCC in our department of radiotherapy between 1998 and 2018 (n\u2009=\u2009131), evaluating treatment, achievement of clinically determined improvement of neurological functions as well as overall survival (OS) and treatment-related toxicity. Kaplan-Meier estimator was used for survival statistics, log rank test for survival time comparisons, univariable and multivariable Cox regression and logistic regression for assessing potential impacts of variables on survival and symptom relief. 42.7% of patients had DS before RT (n\u2009=\u200956), 57.3% (n\u2009=\u200975) received RT without DS. Symptom relief was achieved in 41.2% of all patients (n\u2009=\u200954, n\u2009=\u200926 of those had DS before RT, p\u2009=\u20090.12). RT completed as intended (p\u2009<\u20090.001) was statistically significant for symptom relief, wherein symptom relief (p\u2009<\u20090.001), completion of RT course as intended (p\u2009=\u20090.01) and more recent treatment dates (p\u2009=\u20090.002) were independent predictors for OS.

    "abstract": "Consistency between malnutrition defined by Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) and Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) has not been thoroughly elucidated in patients with cancer. The study aimed to compare their consistency, and summarize the impact of malnutrition defined by GLIM on adverse outcomes. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to May 1, 2024. Initially, the amalgamated sensitivity, specificity and area under curve (AUC) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Subsequently, hazard ratios (HR) or odd ratios (OR) and 95% CIs for overall survival (OS), all-cause mortality, postoperative complications, disease-free survival (DFS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were pooled. Fifty-six studies (55,767 participants) were included. Compared with PG-SGA criteria, the overall sensitivity, specificity and area under curve (AUC) for GLIM was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.63-0.78), 0.80 (95% CI: 0.65-0.90) and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.75-0.83). Subgroup analysis revealed that the diagnostic value in Asian or among patients aged under 60\u00a0years were higher than non-Asian or those aged over 60\u00a0years. Moreover, GLIM-defined malnutrition was significantly associated with overall survival (OS) [hazard ratios (HR)\u2009=\u20091.57, 95% CI: 1.46-1.67], all-cause mortality (HR\u2009=\u20091.43, 95% CI: 1.29-1.57), postoperative complications [odd ratios (OR)\u2009=\u20091.57, 95% CI: 1.40-1.73], disease-free survival (DFS) (OR\u2009=\u20091.52, 95% CI: 1.36-1.68) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (OR\u2009=\u20091.41, 95% CI: 1.10-1.72). GLIM criteria exhibit moderate diagnostic accuracy for identifying malnutrition among patients with cancer, when compared to the PG-SGA. This accuracy is pronounced in the Asian and patients under the age of 60. Furthermore, GLIM-defined malnutrition was significantly associated with OS, DFS, RFS, all-cause mortality and postoperative complication risks in patients with cancer.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal malignancies and most often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Identification of markers for the early diagnosis of PDAC is crucial. In this study, we aimed to identify novel mRNA biomarkers for diagnosing PDAC, focusing on early-stage tumorigenesis and associated immunological changes. Blood samples and clinical information from 1,963 individuals were obtained from a single tertiary hospital between 2015 and 2021. Candidate mRNA biomarkers were identified through literature review, and their expression levels in buffy coat samples were measured using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Machine learning-based feature selection confirmed the final biomarker panel, which was tested using an independent dataset for diagnostic performance. In total, 1,504 individuals (417 patients with PDAC and 1,087 non-disease controls) were eligible for the study. Among the 55 candidate biomarkers identified, 15 mRNAs (CCL5, CCR5, CLEC7A, CXCL8, CXCR2, CXCR4, FOXP3, IFNA1, IFNL1, PTGES, PTGES2, PTGS2, SLC27A2, TNF, and VEGFA) were selected based on their diagnostic performance in distinguishing PDAC from control groups. The final model, HELP-15 (Human Early Liquid biopsy for PDAC), identified all PDAC stages (area under the curve [AUC]\u2009=\u20090.956) in the test set. For resectable pancreatic cancer (RPC), the AUC was 0.968, compared to 0.910 for carbohydrate antigen 19\u2009-\u20099 (CA19-9). The combined model of the panel and CA19-9 achieved an AUC of 0.985 in patients with RPC. For all PDAC stages in patients with normal CA19-9 levels, the AUC of the panel was 0.967, whereas CA19-9 alone or in combination with the panel had AUCs of 0.658 and 0.885, respectively. Compared to CA19-9, the mRNA biomarker panel, HELP-15, improved diagnostic performance in patients with RPC, particularly in those with normal CA19-9 levels.",

    "abstract": "Postoperative chemotherapy is an essential treatment in locally advanced colon cancer, however, effective biomarkers for predicting patients who will benefit from this therapy are lacking. This study aims to explore the clinical value of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) in guiding adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with colon cancer. PRMT5 expression was determined via immunohistochemistry (IHC) in tumor and paratumor samples from 199 colon cancer patients who underwent radical surgery. The correlation between PRMT5 expression and clinicopathological parameters, as well as clinical outcomes, was subsequently investigated. The protein expression levels of PRMT5 were significantly elevated in colon cancer tissues compared to paratumor tissues (P\u2009<\u20090.01). However, the expression of PRMT5 in colon cancer did not show a significant association with various clinicopathological parameters, including sex, age, tumor location, histological differentiation, TNM stage, vascular invasion, or microsatellite status. Notably, a strong correlation was observed between PRMT5 expression and adjuvant therapeutic outcomes: patients with high PRMT5 expression exhibited a lower 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate compared to those with low PRMT5 expression within the chemotherapy group (50% vs. 67.2%, P\u2009=\u20090.039). In contrast, PRMT5 expression did not correlate with clinical outcomes in the non-chemotherapy group. Furthermore, multivariate analysis indicated that PRMT5 expression, along with N stage and microsatellite status, served as independent risk factors for 5-year DFS in patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy. This study highlights PRMT5 as a prognostic marker for adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with colon cancer. The findings suggest that PRMT5 expression may serve as an important predictor of therapeutic outcomes, providing valuable insights for clinical decision-making and personalized treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "The nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH1)/NR5A2 is aberrantly expressed in diverse cancer types, including liver and lung cancers. Since we previously showed that excessive phosphorylation of human LRH1 at S510 (hLRH1<sup>pS510</sup>-high) is predictable of hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence, we here clarified the clinicopathological and biological significance of hLRH1<sup>pS510</sup>-high in lung cancer. By immunohistochemistry using an anti-hLRH1<sup>pS510</sup> monoclonal antibody, we evaluated the hLRH1<sup>pS510</sup> signals in 151 and 150 cases of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) tissues, respectively, and performed clinicopathological analysis. hLRH1<sup>pS510</sup> was localized in the nucleus of tumor cells in LUAD and LUSC tissues with different intensity and proportions among the patients. Of note, the strong hLRH1<sup>pS510</sup> signal was occasionally detectable in LUAD and LUSC cells at the expanding tumor edges. A semi-quantitative analysis revealed that 28 (18.4%) and 36 (24.0%) of LUAD and LUSC cases, respectively, exhibited hLRH1<sup>pS510</sup>-high. Kaplan-Meier plots showed significant differences in the disease-free survival (DFS) between the hLRH1<sup>pS510</sup>-high and hLRH1<sup>pS510</sup>-low groups in LUSC, but not in LUAD patients. hLRH1<sup>pS510</sup>-high was also significantly correlated with recurrence in LUSC patients. Additionally, by multivariate analysis, hLRH1<sup>pS510</sup>-high represented an independent biomarker for the DFS of LUSC patients. Furthermore, the impact of hLRH1<sup>pS510</sup> on the viability of LUSC cells was evaluated by comparing phenotypes among two distinct LUSC cell lines expressing wild-type LRH1, LRH1S510A, and LRH1S510E. Consequently, we demonstrated that phosphorylation of hLRH1S510 accelerates the viability of LUSC cells. Thus, hLRH1<sup>pS510</sup> is attractive not only as the predictive biomarker for LUSC but also as the potential therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Sacrococcygeal teratoma (SCT) is the most common congenital tumor. The incidence of malignant types is rare but increases with late detection or in case of relapse. Prenatal diagnosis is based on ultrasound examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Since this is a rare congenital anomaly, we should report all cases to improve prenatal diagnosis and postnatal management. Retrospective analysis of sixteen cases of sacrococcygeal teratoma delivered and treated at the University Hospital Brno between 2005 and 2020. The following criteria were evaluated: gestational week of the primary diagnosis, exact description of ultrasound findings, pregnancy management, delivery mode, correlation of prenatal ultrasound with postnatal findings in the newborn, as well as the occurrence of early and late complications in newborns and children. Out of sixteen cases, seven cases (43.8%) were indicated for pregnancy termination based on ultrasound findings, the parent's decision, and an estimation of an adverse pregnancy outcome. In nine cases (56.2%), the pregnancy continued and was ended by delivery. In one case, there was an early postnatal death of a newborn after birth in the 25th week of gestation. In eight cases, live fetuses were born in which the tumor was surgically removed between day 1 and 14 months after birth. There was a strong correlation between the tumor description made by prenatal ultrasound diagnosis and related severe complications in newborns. The incidence of severe early and late complications in ongoing pregnancies was very low-only one case of infection in the surgical wound requiring reoperation (12.5%) was described. In two patients (25%), a transient stoma establishment was necessary for secondary ileus. One case of recurrence of the disease at two years of age occurred, requiring the administration of chemotherapy (12.5%), and one patient has mild persistent urinary incontinence. Sacrococcygeal teratoma is one of the rarest congenital malformations. A detailed prenatal ultrasound examination is essential to estimate the pregnancy prognosis. The most predictive ultrasound predictor of favorable early and late postnatal outcomes and long-term child development is the presence of cystic sacrococcygeal formation, the most common tumor type, and the absence of signs of cardiac failure due to fetal anemia. In these cases, with early surgical treatment provided, the incidence of severe complications and long-term consequences in children is very low, and parents should be informed during prenatal counseling. It is necessary to register all the SCT cases due to the rarity of this congenital anomaly for further statistical analysis of the importance of ultrasound markers.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate cytokines as a prognostic biomarker in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) undergoing immunotherapy. A comprehensive analysis was conducted to assess the prognostic significance of sCD14 and other cytokines in aNSCLC patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) using flow fluorescence. A discovery cohort (n\u2009=\u200942) was used to evaluate the differential expression of 41 cytokines between durable clinical benefit (DCB) and no durable benefit (NDB) groups in Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CHCAMS). The prognostic value was further validated in multiple independent cohorts, including plasma protein measurements (n\u2009=\u2009109), multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) (n\u2009=\u200922), and messenger RNA datasets (n\u2009=\u2009403) of NSCLC in CHCAMS. In the discovery cohort, 7 cytokines (CD14, CCL27, IL-17\u00a0A, EGF, TNFR1, GFAP, CHI3L1) exhibited differential expression between the DCB and NDB groups. Among these, CD14, CCL27, IL-17\u00a0A, and TNFR1 were significantly elevated in the DCB group, while EGF, CHI3L1, and CCL5 were higher in the NDB group. CD14 showed a high area under the curve (AUC\u2009=\u20090.84) for predicting clinical benefit. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that these cytokines are involved in key immune pathways, including the inflammatory response and MAPK signaling. Univariate COX for progression-free survival (PFS) analysis demonstrated prognostic value for CD14 (p\u2009<\u20090.001, HR\u2009=\u20090.054 [0.014-0.219]), CCL27 (p\u2009<\u20090.001, HR\u2009=\u20090.054 [0.015-0.196]), IL-17\u00a0A (p\u2009<\u20090.001, HR\u2009=\u20090.110 [0.041-0.298]), and CCL5 (p\u2009<\u20090.05, HR\u2009=\u20092.387 [1.023-5.570]). Validation in the CHCAMS cohort confirmed that CD14 expression, measured via mIF, was a predictor of PFS (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Furthermore, high CD14 expression was consistently associated with superior PFS across multiple external datasets (GSE126044, GSE135222, GSE136961, and GSE218989). CD14 expression was found to be elevated in various normal tissue types, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma, compared to tumors, indicating its potential role in immune surveillance. sCD14 is a promising prognostic biomarker for aNSCLC patients undergoing immunotherapy. Elevated plasma sCD14 levels are associated with improved PFS and a favorable immune response.",

    "title": "Identification and validation of a lenvatinib resistance-related prognostic signature in HCC, in which PFKFB4 contributes to tumor progression and lenvatinib resistance.",
    "abstract": "Drug resistance reflects the evolution of tumors and represents the leading factor behind recurrence and death. Lenvatinib is the first-line therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its effectiveness is limited by rapid development of resistance. Therefore, we aimed to identify lenvatinib resistance-related genes and assess their influence on prognosis and treatment response in HCC. The GSE186191 dataset served as the discovery cohort to identify lenvatinib resistance-related genes. A Venn diagram analysis delineated the intersection between lenvatinib resistance-related genes and prognostic-associated genes derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The LASSO Cox regression model was implemented to construct a multigene signature in the TCGA cohort. A nomogram was built by integrating the TNM stage and our prognostic model. The gene signature and nomogram were further validated using HCC patients from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) cohort. Mutation signatures, therapeutic response, functional enrichment, and immune profile analyses were performed in the two groups. Two lenvatinib-resistant (LR) HCC cells were established using a concentration gradient increment method. PFKFB4 expression was detected via qRT-PCR and western blot assay. The CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry were utilized to evaluate the proliferation and apoptosis of LR cells under different interventions. We developed a lenvatinib resistance-related gene signature (ALPK3, SLC2A2, CTSV, and PFKFB4), and demonstrated that's a precise, independent, and specific prognostic model for HCC patients. High-risk patients were characterized by a predisposition to TP53 mutations, aggressive tumor features, and treatment resistance. The risk score was significantly associated with immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint expression, angiogenesis, and tumor stemness. PFKFB4 was overexpressed in LR cells, and its knockdown significantly enhances the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of lenvatinib on resistant cells. The lenvatinib resistance-related prognostic signature exhibits strong predictive power for prognosis in HCC patients and may serve as an effective tool for guiding treatment decisions. PFKFB4 promotes tumor progression and lenvatinib resistance, highlighting its potential as a novel therapeutic target for HCC. Not applicable.",

    "abstract": "The high incidence of unplanned readmissions within 31\u00a0days after colorectal cancer surgery remains a significant challenge. However, the identified risk factors for these readmissions are inconsistent across the literature. This study aims to perform a comprehensive meta-analysis to estimate the incidence of unplanned readmissions and systematically identify the factors associated with this risk, providing robust evidence for targeted interventions to reduce readmission rates. This study was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. All study steps, including study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment, were independently performed by two authors, with any disagreements resolved through consultation with a third author. A comprehensive search for published studies was conducted across the following databases up to January 2025: VIP Journal Database, Wanfang Data, CNKI, SinoMed, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. Statistical analyses were performed using RevMan 5.4 and Stata 17.0, with a p-value of less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. This meta-analysis identified several significant risk factors associated with unplanned readmission during this period (P\u2009<\u20090.05), including age (OR\u2009=\u20091.13), postoperative complications (OR\u2009=\u20091.87), tumor stage (TNM\u2009\u2265\u2009III) (OR\u2009=\u20092.01), tumor site in the rectum (OR\u2009=\u20091.64), stoma creation (OR\u2009=\u20091.70), Complicated diabetes (OR\u2009=\u20091.56), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) (OR\u2009=\u20091.27), blood transfusion (BT) (OR\u2009=\u20091.24), Length of hospital stay (LOS) (OR\u2009=\u20091.65), and surgical approach (OR\u2009=\u20091.22). Notably, female (OR\u2009=\u20090.85) was identified as a protective factor against unplanned readmission. The unplanned readmission rate within 31\u00a0days after colorectal cancer surgery was 11.73%. Current evidence suggests that age, postoperative complications, TNM\u2009\u2265\u2009III, tumor site in the rectum, stoma creation, complicated diabetes, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), blood transfusion (BT), length of hospital stay (LOS), and surgical approach are significant risk factors for unplanned readmission. Conversely, female has been identified as a protective factor. To mitigate these risks and reduce readmission rates, healthcare professionals should implement targeted educational and clinical interventions.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) has steadily increased over the past decade, and recent studies have linked bile acid (BA) metabolism to its development. However, the metabolic profile of BAs and their potential as biomarkers in ccRCC pathogenesis remain poorly characterized, making their evaluation crucial for advancing disease understanding and management. A total of 68 newly diagnosed ccRCC patients and 63 healthy controls were enrolled. Serum bile acid (BA) profiles were measured using Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structures Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) model analyzed differences in serum BA profiles between ccRCC patients and controls. Additionally, the relationship between BA profiles and tumor heterogeneity parameters was investigated. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis identified potential biomarkers for ccRCC pathogenesis. The BA profile was altered in ccRCC patients and was not influenced by sex or age. Specifically, primary and secondary unconjugated BA fractions were significantly higher in the ccRCC population. Five BA metabolite candidates exhibited the most significant differences between ccRCC patients and controls. Deoxycholic acid (DCA) was associated with pathological pTNM stage classification and grade. Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), combined with testosterone, showed potential as biomarkers for the pathogenesis of ccRCC. Alterations in the serum BA profile are observed in ccRCC. Deoxycholic acid (DCA) correlates with pathological pTNM stage classification and tumor grade. Additionally, CDCA combined with LCA show potential as biomarkers for ccRCC pathogenesis. Not applicable.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this research study is to determine the efficacy of dual contrast-enhanced ultrasound (US) in evaluating ductal papillary lesions associated with pathological nipple discharge. A prospective multicenter study was conducted between January 2020 and December 2022. All participants were examined using dual contrast-enhanced US and had re-adjustment of BI-RADS classification. Genuine ductal papillary lesions were identified using US features and subsequently subjected to biopsy or excision. Using pathological results and clinical follow-up as the reference standard as a standard reference, we compared the diagnostic efficacy of dual contrast-enhanced US to conventional US in detecting papillary lesions. The study included 102 female participants ranging in age from 29 to 80 years (average 47.6\u2009\u00b1\u20099.4), of whom 87 were retained for analysis. We precisely localized discharging ducts with papillary lesions in 85 patients, with 68 showing varying degrees of enhancement in papillary lesions. Compared to conventional US, dual contrast-enhanced US was more accurate in locating and detecting papillary lesions (P\u2009<\u20090.001). The optimized BI-RADS classification allowed for a more informed prediction of the malignancy risk associated with papillary lesions. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that ductal continuity, the boundary between the nodule and duct, and peak intensity are independent risk factors for malignancy. The area under the curve for detecting malignant papillary lesions was 0.937. Dual contrast-enhanced US is effective at precisely locating lactiferous ducts in pathological nipple discharge, detecting and differentiating papillary lesions, and improving the accuracy of BI-RADS classification.",

    "title": "Airway management in patients with surgical treatment of oral cavity carcinoma.",
    "abstract": "Local tumor-related anatomical changes can complicate the anesthetic airway management of patients with carcinoma of the oral cavity. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there are predictive factors for the occurrence of a difficult airway in this patient cohort and whether a difficult airway influences postoperative outcome. In addition, the influence of an intraoperative tracheostomy on postoperative outcome was to be analyzed. The treatment records of 201 patients with oral cavity carcinoma who underwent surgery between 2012 and 2023 in a single center were retrospectively analyzed. The definition of difficult airway corresponded to the current S1 guideline of the German Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine from 2015. An association between possible predictive factors and a difficult airway was investigated. The influence of BMI, Mallampati score and Cormack/Lehane score on the number of intubation attempts was analyzed separately. Furthermore, the influence of a difficult airway on the duration of intubation and the duration of the postoperative inpatient stay as well as the postoperative ICU stay was investigated. In addition, the association between an intraoperative tracheostomy and the duration of intubation as well as the duration of the postoperative inpatient stay was analyzed. Difficult airway occurred in 15 patients (7,5%) and 136 (68%) underwent intraoperative tracheostomy. An indirect laryngoscopy was used in advance in 32,8% of the total patients and 45,4% of the patients undergoing revision surgery. Among the investigated variables, no predictive factors for a difficult airway could be identified. Regarding the number of intubation attempts required, a higher BMI and Mallampati score did not lead to increased number of intubation attempts; however, patients with a Cormack/Lehane score of 3 were significantly more likely to require 2 attempts than patients with a score of 1 or 2 (p\u2009=\u20090.0225). The success rate of first intubation attempt was 78% with videolaryngoscopy, compared to 95,5% when direct laryngoscopy was used (p\u2009=\u20090,0008). A difficult airway did not lead to prolonged postoperative ICU stay and total hospitalisation length. Patients with an intraoperative tracheostomy had a significantly longer mechanical ventilation and total hospitalisation length than patients without (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Within the limitations of this study, no patient-specific predictors for a difficult airway were identified in patients with oral cavity carcinoma. Videolaryngoscopy in advance did not increase the success rate of the first intubation attempt compared to direct laryngoscopy. Despite this, videolaryngoscopy may be a preferable approach in this population, especially in patients undergoing revision surgeries. The results highlight the importance of a careful preoperative assessment with clearly defined criteria for a difficult airway and appropriate anaesthesiological preparation to avoid complications during intubation.

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third major cause of cancer death worldwide, with more than a doubling of incidence over the past two decades in the United States. Yet, the survival rate remains less than 20%, often due to late diagnosis at advanced stages. Current HCC screening approaches are serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) testing and ultrasound (US) of cirrhotic patients. However, these remain suboptimal, particularly in the setting of underlying obesity and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease/steatohepatitis (MASLD/MASH), which are also rising in incidence. Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel biomarkers that can stratify risk and predict early diagnosis of HCC, which is curable. Advances in liver cancer biology, multi-omics technologies, artificial intelligence, and precision algorithms have facilitated the development of promising candidates, with several emerging from completed phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. This review highlights the performance of these novel biomarkers and algorithms from a mechanistic perspective and provides new insight into how pathological processes can be detected through blood-based biomarkers. Through human studies compiled with animal models and mechanistic insight in pathways such as the TGF-\u03b2 pathway, the biological progression from chronic liver disease to cirrhosis and HCC can be delineated. This integrated approach with new biomarkers merit further validation to refine HCC screening and improve early detection and risk stratification.",

Retrospective analysis of clinical records. Patients who underwent ENB-guided transbronchial MWA at the Department of Thoracic Surgery, Tongji Hospital. Patients were categorized into two groups: those who received CBCT during the procedure and those who did not. Technical and ablation success rates, complication rates, and patient characteristics were assessed. A total of 283 patients with 371 nodules were included in the final analysis. The technical success rate was significantly higher in the CBCT group (97.0%) compared to the non-CBCT group (91.5%, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.034). The overall ablation success rate was 88.1%, with the CBCT group demonstrating a higher rate (90.9% vs 81.5%, <i>p</i>\u2009=\u20090.018). Complication rates were similar between the two groups, with no significant differences. The use of CBCT in ENB-guided transbronchial MWA significantly increases the technical and ablation success rates without raising complication rates. These findings underscore the potential advantages of CBCT in enhancing procedural outcomes for patients with pulmonary nodules.

Local thermal interventions alter these biophysical characteristics of the tumor. To characterize time-dependent and thermal dose-related effects of radiofrequency hyperthermic (RFHT) interventions on intratumoral pressure and tumor stiffness. Two treatment protocols (high input power > 1\u2009W and low input power < 1\u2009W) were investigated using a computational modeling approach and a syngeneic rat HCC tumor model with a customized monopolar RFHT system. Intratumoral pressure and stiffness were assessed using piezo-electric sensors and ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE), respectively, across three groups (untreated tumors, tumors treated with high and low RFHT) and time points (immediately after treatment, at 24\u2009h, and 48\u2009h). The developed RFHT system maintained electrode-tip temperatures of 74.1\u2009\u00b1\u20095.2\u2009\u00b0C (high RFHT) and 45.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6\u2009\u00b0C (low RFHT) for 15\u2009min.

    "abstract": "To explore the value of advanced MRI techniques in predicting the effect of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) on uterine fibroids and to establish a prediction model. This study enrolled 40 patients with 52 uterine fibroids who underwent HIFU at our hospital. All patients were scanned using multiple MRI sequences before HIFU therapy, including non-contrast enhanced MRI, contrast-enhanced MRI, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), arterial spin labeling (ASL), and T1 mapping. MRI sequences that could predict the HIFU effect were identified, and the predictive performance was evaluated using ROC curves. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses were employed to investigate independent predictors and establish a prediction model. In addition, we assessed and verified the performance of the model. Hyperintense on T2 weighted imaging (T2WI), large apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values derived from DWI, and high perfusion index derived from ASL were associated with a poor HIFU effect. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses suggested that uterine position, ADC value and perfusion index were independent predictors for establishing the prediction model. The AUC of the prediction model was 0.939. Both the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and the calibration curve indicated good calibration. The decision curve analysis (DCA) curve showed good clinical benefits, and the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) revealed that the model had good predictive performance and generalization ability.

    "abstract": "Cerebral infarction following abdominal surgical procedures is a rare but serious complication in children. We report a rare case of a full-term neonate who developed a cerebral infarction after laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy. A neonate weighing 2350\u2009g was prenatally diagnosed with a 30\u2009mm complex ovarian cyst that was suspected to be torsional. At 3\u2009days of age, she underwent laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy under general anesthesia. During the procedure, the twisted ovarian cyst, located in the upper abdomen, was excised after fluid drainage. The surgery lasted 64\u2009min, with a pneumoperitoneum time of 33\u2009min at a pressure of 8\u2009mmHg. The surgery was uneventful. Hemodynamics were managed with fluid and albumin administration throughout the procedure. After pneumoperitoneum, blood pressure was decreased temporally, and ephedrine was administered, which led to recovery. However, at 12\u2009h after surgery, cranial ultrasonography revealed a high-density area in the left basal ganglia, which was not detected in the head ultrasound preoperatively. This was later confirmed to be a cerebral infarction by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). No cardiac or vascular malformations or hypercoagulability were observed. No additional treatment was administered for cerebral infarction. She was discharged 14\u2009days after surgery. Follow-up MRI at 3\u2009years post-surgery indicated chronic infarction. Fortunately, the patient exhibited no neurological abnormalities. This case highlights the importance of identifying and mitigating the perioperative risks of cerebral infarction to improve the outcomes of laparoscopic surgery in neonates.",

    "title": "Feature selection with vector-symbolic architectures: a case study on microbial profiles of shotgun metagenomic samples of colorectal cancer.",
    "abstract": "The continuously decreasing cost of next-generation sequencing has recently led to a significant increase in the number of microbiome-related studies, providing invaluable information for understanding host-microbiome interactions and their relation to diseases. A common approach in metagenomics consists of determining the composition of samples in terms of the amount and types of microbial species that populate them, with the goal of identifying microbes whose profiles are able to differentiate samples under different conditions with advanced feature selection techniques. Here, we propose a novel backward variable selection method based on the hyperdimensional computing (HDC) paradigm, which takes inspiration from how the human brain works in the classification of concepts by encoding features into vectors in a high-dimensional space. We validated our method on public metagenomic samples collected from patients affected by colorectal cancer in a case/control scenario, by performing a comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art feature selection methods, obtaining promising results. Characterizing the microbial composition of metagenomic samples is crucial for identifying potential biomarkers that can distinguish between healthy and diseased states. However, the high dimensionality and complexity of metagenomic data present significant challenges in the context of accurately selecting features. Our backward variable selection method, based on the HDC paradigm, offers a promising approach to overcoming these challenges. By effectively reducing the feature space while preserving essential information, this method enhances the ability to detect critical microbial signatures associated with diseases like colorectal cancer, leading to more precise diagnostic tools.",

    "title": "Arm-Behind-the-Back Position for Breast Cancer Radiotherapy in Patients with Lupus Erythematosus and Shoulder Arthropathy: A Case Report.",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND When 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) for postoperative breast cancer is performed in the supine position, patients are required to raise their arms to spare the arms from the irradiation field. However, patients with collagen vascular disease can experience severe joint symptoms. CASE REPORT A 43-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) 10 years ago received a diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast. Breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. The pathological stage was IA. Physical and immunological examinations indicated that SLE disease activity was stable preoperatively and postoperatively. She had difficulty holding her left arm in a raised position because of arthritis related to SLE and steroid therapy. For postoperative radiation therapy, we developed an arm-behind-the-back position, in which a platform was placed between the patient's body and couch. In this position, the patient's arm was lowered behind the back, such that the arm did not interfere with the irradiation field of 3DCRT. The treatment plan achieved an acceptable homogeneity index, low dose to the lungs and heart, and no problematic hotspots. Although the time required for position matching and irradiation tended to be longer than that in the regular supine position, scheduled irradiation was safely completed. Grade 2 radiation dermatitis was observed. The patient showed no signs of local recurrence or distant metastases after 15 months. No radiation pneumonitis was observed. CONCLUSIONS The ingenuity of positioning can achieve radiotherapy in patients with collagen vascular disease and shoulder joint symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Cervical cancer remains a significant global health challenge, with persistent infection by oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) types identified as a necessary condition for its development. HPV vaccines have emerged as a crucial tool for preventing precancerous genital lesions and cervical cancer linked to specific HPV types. Over recent years, leading oncology and gynecology societies across the United States, Europe, and Australia have issued clinical guidelines aimed at optimizing the implementation of population-based HPV vaccination programs. This narrative review synthesizes key recommendations for HPV vaccination programs, focusing on guidelines published between 2019 and 2024. A total of 16 guidelines were analyzed, revealing unanimous support for vaccinating children - ideally before the age of 15 years - to ensure protection prior to sexual activity. Most recommendations emphasize the vaccination of girls and boys, with the 9-valent Gardasil 9 vaccine identified as the preferred option. A major milestone was reached in 2022, when the World Health Organization proposed a single-dose regimen as an effective strategy, offering potential benefits in public health accessibility and program efficiency. This article aims to review and compare current international guidelines for vaccination programs for human papilloma virus.",

    "title": "The use of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.",
    "abstract": "Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is a heterogeneous group of rare malignancies with limited response to conventional chemotherapy. Among these, epithelioid haemangioendothelioma (EHE) and angiosarcoma represent rare vascular sarcomas with distinct clinical behaviours, challenging treatment approaches, and poor prognoses. Doxorubicin remains the standard first-line therapy for metastatic STS, but its use is constrained by dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) has been proposed as an alternative. This retrospective, registry-based cohort study investigates the efficacy of PLD in patients with locally advanced or metastatic STS treated at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark, between 2008 and 2023. Patients were identified from a regional database, and progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analysed. A total of 38 patients were included, with 6 diagnosed with EHE and 16 with angiosarcoma. Among EHE patients, all had metastatic disease at diagnosis, with a median PFS of 7.8 months and OS of 1.5 years from the start of PLD treatment. Two patients remained progression-free for over 5 years. In angiosarcoma patients, the median PFS was 7.4 months, and the median OS was 2.4 years. Other STS subtype including solitary fibrous tumours (SFT), showed minimal benefit from PLD, with a median PFS of 2.8 months. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin demonstrated clinically relevant activity in angiosarcoma and EHE. It may be considered a therapeutic option for patients with these aggressive vascular sarcomas. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm its efficacy and optimised treatment strategies.",

    "title": "Peptide-Based Strategies in PLGA-Enhanced Tumor Therapy.",
    "abstract": "Peptide-based therapeutics have gained attention in cancer treatment because of their good specificity, low toxicity, and ability to modulate immune responses. However, challenges such as enzymatic degradation and poor bioavailability limit their clinical application. Peptide-functionalized poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) systems have emerged as a transformative platform in cancer therapy that offers unique advantages, including enhanced stability, sustained release, and precise delivery of therapeutic agents. This review highlights the synergistic integration of peptides with PLGA and addresses key challenges of peptide-based therapeutics. The application of peptide-functionalized PLGA systems encompasses a diverse range of strategies for cancer therapy. In chemotherapy, peptides disrupt critical tumor pathways, induce apoptosis, and inhibit angiogenesis, demonstrating their versatility in targeting various aspects of tumor progression. In immunotherapy, peptides act as antigens to stimulate robust immune responses or as immune checkpoint inhibitors to restore T cell activity, overcoming tumor immune evasion. These systems also harness the enhanced permeability and retention effect, facilitating preferential accumulation in tumor tissues while leveraging tumor microenvironment (TME)-responsive mechanisms, such as pH-sensitive or enzyme-triggered drug release, to achieve controlled, localized delivery. Collectively, peptide-functionalized PLGA systems represent a promising, versatile approach for precise cancer therapy that integrates innovative delivery strategies with highly specific, potent therapeutic agents.",

    "abstract": "Palliative rectal cancer patients typically retain their primary tumour, as trials have concluded no survival benefit of tumour resection in non-curative patients. This patient group is understudied regarding the natural course of the remaining tumour, particularly concerning the need of surgical management. This was a retrospective study on rectal cancer patients diagnosed between 2007 and 2020 in Region V\u00e4sterbotten, Sweden. Data were obtained from the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Registry and chart review. Patients were excluded if treated with curative intent, underwent primary tumour resection, had a synchronous colorectal cancer, had locally recurrent colorectal cancer, or refused treatment. Patients were followed from diagnosis until death or end of follow-up. Indications for palliative treatment, tumour-related complications and surgical and oncological management were investigated, with a stratified analysis for study period and patient age. Some 156 patients remained after applying exclusion criteria. The majority had metastasized and incurable disease (76%). Almost half suffered local complications (44%) and 48% underwent surgical intervention, due to the unremoved primary tumour. Tumour perforation occurred in 7% with a significantly higher risk in patients aged \u226475\u2009years (p\u2009=\u20090.009). Bowel obstruction afflicted 23%, while 40% underwent stoma diversion. Almost half received chemotherapy (48%) and radiotherapy (42%), respectively. Rectal cancer patients with an unremoved primary tumour face a substantial risk of local complications, often necessitating surgical intervention. Therefore, the benefits of surgical resection should be carefully considered, especially for patients with a longer estimated survival. Further research is needed to accurately identify patients where tumour removal might be beneficial.",

Eligible adult patients (\u2265\u200918\u2009years) with resectable clinical stage (CS) IA-IIIB NSCLC (7th AJCC) diagnosed from 01/01/2013 to 31/12/2017 were followed until death, last recorded clinical visit, or 31/12/2020 (data cut-off). Of 755 patients (CS I: 30.6%, CS II: 35.0%, CS III: 34.2%) with a median age of 62 [range: 56-69] years enrolled, 69.3% were male, and 75.0% were current/ex-smokers. Of 24.2% of patients tested for EGFR, 28.4% (52/183) were positive, while 23/44 patients tested (52.3%) had PD-L1 expression (\u2265\u20091%: 16; unknown: 7). Overall, 82.9% had surgery, of whom 39.1% (245/626) had surgery alone; 21.1% received neoadjuvant therapy, 51.1% received adjuvant therapy, and 5.8% received both; 11.2% (58/519) patients received targeted therapy (adjuvant: 47 patients; neoadjuvant: 11 patients), and 4.6% (24/519) received immunotherapy (adjuvant: 22 patients; neoadjuvant: 2 patients). The 3-year survival was 77.4% with a median overall survival (mOS) of 7.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.7-NE) years, with the highest mOS recorded with adjuvant therapy (7.5 [95% CI: 7.0-NE] years). This real-world study showed >\u200950% use of adjuvant therapy per guideline recommendations but poor use of neoadjuvant therapy. Biomarker testing at diagnosis was low, reflecting the study period being before targeted and immunotherapies. With recent approvals of newer (neo)adjuvant agents, a multidisciplinary approach is needed for better treatment decisions to improve the prognosis of early-stage NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "High-risk HPV infection is a necessary but not sufficient factor for the development of precancerous lesions and cervical cancer. Beyond mere HPV positivity, the persistence of infection over time plays a crucial role. This study aims to evaluate the clearance and persistence rates of HPV 16 and 18 genotypes. The cervical cytology results were reported using the 2014 Bethesda System classification. The cervical cytology samples were analyzed using the Roche Cobas\u00ae 4800 HPV tests. Patients with any HPV genotype other than 16 or 18, those with missing data, those who were lost to follow-up, those who underwent excisional procedures or hysterectomy, and those with high-grade cervical dysplasia were excluded from this study. Among 191 patients (mean age: 41.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6\u2009years, 16.8% postmenopausal), the mean follow-up was 21.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7\u2009months. No significant differences were found between the clearance and persistence groups in age, follow-up duration, cervical biopsy, or endocervical curettage results. However, HPV 16 had a higher persistence rate (28.2%), and abnormal cytology was more frequent in the persistence group (p\u2009=\u20090.038). Around 25% of patients had persistent HPV infection. Close monitoring is essential for those with CIN 1 on initial colposcopy, as they may have a higher risk of progressing to high-grade dysplasia compared to those without dysplasia.",

Here, we describe the case of a 59-year-old GBM patient who experienced LMS during his treatment. Despite multimodal therapy, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, the patient's condition rapidly deteriorated. The case illustrates the difficulty in treating GBM and the restricted ability of available therapies to stop LMS. This manifestation is uncommon, which highlights the need for increased awareness, ongoing study, and development of tailored treatments. Key factors influencing LMS include tumour size, age, and anatomical location. Diagnostic challenges arise due to the rarity of LMS in GBM and its atypical presentation. Therapeutic interventions targeting LMS are lacking, with poor prognosis and low survival rates. To improve patient outcomes, more studies should be done on creating efficient treatment regimens and figuring out the markers associated with LMS development in GBM.",

    "abstract": "Cisplatin (DDP) resistance is a key factor hindering esophageal cancer (ESCA) treatment. Exosomes have been reported to confer resistance to DDP in various tumor cells. However, the effects of ESCA cell-derived exosomes and exosomal human antigen R (HuR) on DDP resistance in cancer cells have not been elucidated. In this study, isolated exosomes were identified by transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and western blotting. CCK-8 and flow cytometry were employed to assess the functional role of exosomes in ESCA DDP-resistant cells and their parental cells. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify molecules that were positively associated with HuR and validated using dual-luciferase reporter analysis and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. We found that exosomes from ESCA cells enhance the resistance of drug-resistant cells to DDP. Importantly, HuR protein, but not mRNA, was directly transferred into DDP-resistant cells via exosomes, thereby increasing the level of HuR protein. Mechanistically, HuR positively correlated with Lamin B2 (LMNB2) in ESCA cells, and ESCA DDP-resistant cells transfected with siRNA targeting LMNB2 exhibited reduced cell viability and elevated apoptosis rates. Moreover, the role of ESCA cell-derived exosomes in the transmission of DDP resistance <i>in vivo</i> was validated using a nude mouse model. Collectively, our results revealed that exosomes exposed to ESCA cells induced greater drug resistance in DDP-resistant ESCA cells via HuR delivery. Targeting HuR or its positively related target LMNB2 may present new therapeutic opportunities for treating patients with DDP-resistant ESCA.",

A publicly available dataset composed of 590 patient urine samples was utilized to develop six conventional models for the classification of cancerous from non-cancerous pancreatic cases through the analysis of specific attributes. An ensemble voting classifier was developed from the best-performed single models, which were later hybridized to form six novel hybrid models. The ensemble voting classifier outperformed all stand-alone models with an accuracy of 96.61% and a precision of 98.72%. The six novel hybrid models exhibited higher performance than single models with voting classifier random forest hybridized model outperforming others with an AUC of 99.05% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93-1.00) and an interpretation was given by SHAP showing top influential features in pancreatic cancer diagnosis that exhibited the greatest positive SHAP values.

GRNs were reconstructed using the RTN package which identifies regulons-sets of genes regulated by a common TF based on co-expression and mutual information. Regulon activity was evaluated through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Elastic net regularization and Cox regression identified 31 and 32 prognostic genes in the TCGA and CGGA datasets, respectively, with 11 genes overlapping, many of which are associated with neural development and synaptic processes. GAS2L3, HOXD13, and OTP demonstrated the strongest correlations with survival outcomes among these. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of 201,986 cells revealed distinct expression patterns for these genes in glioma subpopulations, particularly oligoprogenitor cells. This study uncovers key GRNs and prognostic genes in gliomas, offering new insights into tumor biology and potential therapeutic targets.",

    "title": "Salinomycin and oxaliplatin synergistically enhances cytotoxic effect on human colorectal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.",
    "abstract": "Oxaliplatin (OXA) is widely used for colorectal cancer (CRC) as a first-line chemotherapy. However, drug resistance and peripheral neurotoxicity prevail in colorectal cancer therapy. Salinomycin (SAL) makes cancer cells sensitive to ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs. Chemotherapy regimens that combine more than two drugs can improve the outcome of patients. In the present study, we detected apoptosis and mitochondrial function in CRC cells through MTT assays, Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, colony-forming assays, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) measurements, western blotting and so on. We used CompuSyn software to calculate combination index (CI). The effect of SAL and OXA was synergistic. The combination treatment inhibited cell proliferation, migration and colony formation but increased the expression of proapoptotic proteins and promoted cell apoptosis of CRC cells. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the SAL and OXA cotreatment increased intracellular ROS levels in CRC cell lines, decreased the MMP and activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, thus inhibiting the proliferation of CRC cells and promoting the apoptosis of CRC cells. Pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reversed this effect. Cotreatment with SAL and OXA increases the apoptotic effects in OXA-treated CRC cell lines. In vivo, combined treatment of SAL and OXA markedly inhibited the tumor growth compared to either drug alone. SAL enhances OXA-induced antitumor effects in CRC both in vitro and in vivo by ROS-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis and activation of the MAPK pathway. These results may provide a rationale for combining SAL with OXA for CRC treatment.",

    "abstract": "Socio-economic status (SES) is related to breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis. We study if SES is related to the adequacy of the treatment according to Saint Gallen consensus in Spanish women with incident breast cancer. Breast cancer cohort was assembled from incident cases from MCC-Spain and prospective followed-up afterwards. Participants were then classified according to the Saint-Gallen consensus in three categories (In Saint-Gallen, who received therapy accorded by Saint Gallen; Over Saint-Gallen, who received some additional therapy; or Under Saint-Gallen, who did not receive the complete therapy). Association between SES and Saint-Gallen fulfilment was analyzed using multinomial logistic regression, adjusting for clinicopathological and patient-related variables. 1115 patients in stages I and II were included. Women with university education were 58% more likely to receive over Saint-Gallen therapies (RRR\u2009=\u20091.68; 95%CI 0.84-3.33). In the simplified SES score, women with higher SES were over Saint-Gallen 52% more than those with lower SES (RRR\u2009=\u20091.52; 95%CI 0.88-2.64). Women with higher SES more often received over Saint-Gallen therapies. Further analyses are needed to understand the influence of these differences on the overall survival as well as its potential unwanted side effects.",

    "abstract": "The detection of thyroglobulin in lymph node (LN) fine needle aspirates (FNA-Tg) is an effective supplement to ultrasound and fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in diagnosis of cervical LN metastases for patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). However, there is no unique cutoff value of FNA-Tg in practice. We aimed to determine the optimal cutoff of FNA-Tg and evaluate the interfering factors of FNA-Tg. A serial of 405 lateral cervical LN samples from 317 patients with PTC were analyzed retrospectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the optimal cutoff of FNA-Tg. The factors that impact FNA-Tg were evaluated. Serum Tg, serum thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) and serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level, and thyroid status did not differ between the malignant and benign LN groups. The median FNA-Tg was 3.81 ng/mL (0.16-33.40 ng/mL) in LNs without metastasis and 310.32 ng/mL (124.41-500.00 ng/mL) in LNs with metastasis, and the differences reached statistical significance (P\u2009<\u20090.01). The optimal cutoff of FNA-Tg was 36.22 ng/mL, and the values of area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) was 0.88, 0.89, 0.75, 0.91 and 0.71, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of FNA-Tg cutoff of 36.22ng/mL was 85%. When FNAC and the present FNA-Tg cutoff of 36.22 ng/mL were combined together, the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and diagnostic accuracy was 0.96, 0.75, 0.92, 0.87 and 91%, respectively. FNA-Tg improves the diagnostic efficacy of FNAC for PTC lateral cervical LN metastasis, and the optimal cutoff value of FNA-Tg was 36.22 ng/mL. FNA-Tg was affected by LN status but was not associated with serum Tg, serum TgAb, serum TSH and thyroid status.",

    "abstract": "Colon cancer is a prevalent disease on a global scale, thus making its detection and prevention a critical area in the medical field. In addressing the challenges of high annotation costs and the need for improved accuracy in colon polyp detection, this study explores the segment anything model (SAM) application and fine-tuning strategies for colon polyp segmentation. Conventional full fine-tuning approaches frequently result in catastrophic forgetting, thereby compromising the model's generalization capabilities. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an efficient fine-tuning method, PSF-SAM, which mitigates catastrophic forgetting while enhancing performance in few-shot scenarios. This is achieved by freezing most SAM parameters and optimizing only specific structures. The efficacy of PSF-SAM is substantiated by experimental evaluations on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets, which demonstrate its superior performance in metrics such as mDice coefficients and mIoU, as well as its notable advantages in few-shot learning scenarios when compared to existing fine-tuning methods.",

    "abstract": "Cervical cancer (CC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide and still requires effective interventions to improve patient outcomes. Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) is a multifaceted glycoprotein that plays crucial roles in lipid metabolism and tumor progression. ANGPTL4 exhibits both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing effects and has been proposed as a promising target for cancer therapy. This study investigated the role and potential of ANGPTL4 in enhancing therapeutic efficacy in CC using cell line models in vitro. Our analysis revealed a decreased expression of ANGPTL4 in CC samples from the GSE dataset and in the CC cell lines examined. Functional assays demonstrated that ANGPTL4 overexpression suppressed CC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Notably, overexpression of ANGPTL4 resulted in decreased cell viability and increased levels of apoptosis, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved PARP under cisplatin treatment. Furthermore, these analyses were also conducted in ANGPTL4-knockdown cells, and results supporting the tumor-suppressive roles of ANGPTL4 were observed. Taken together, our study elucidates the critical role of ANGPTL4 in modulating progression and chemosensitivity of CC cells, suggesting ANGPTL4 as a potential target for CC treatment.",

    "title": "Preparedness for caregiving among caregivers of breast cancer patients and its association with health literacy and caregiving competence.",
    "abstract": "Family caregivers are considered the main providers of care and support for cancer patients, and need to be adequately prepared for this role. Preparedness for caregiving, a key component of family-centered care, means that family caregivers have the skills and knowledge to fulfill their responsibilities, including addressing patients' physical and emotional needs and coordinating care plans. This study investigated preparedness for caregiving and its association with health literacy and caregiving competence among family caregivers of breast cancer patients. This descriptive correlational cross-sectional study, represented the quantitative phase of a sequential explanatory mixed-methods design. It involved 354 family caregivers of breast cancer patients attending selected oncology and radiotherapy centers in Tabriz, Iran, from March 2023 to January 2024. Data collection instruments included the Individual-Social Characteristics Questionnaire, Preparedness for Caregiving Scale (PCS), Health Literacy Caregiver Scale-Cancer (HLCS-C), and Caregiver Competence Scale (CCS). Data analysis employed descriptive statistics (frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations) and inferential statistics (Pearson's correlation, independent t, one-way ANOVA, and general linear model (GLM)) using SPSS version 16. The means (SD) for preparedness for caregiving, health literacy, and caregiving competence were 21.62\u2009\u00b1\u20094.69 (range: 0-32), 142.97\u2009\u00b1\u200917.23 (range: 42-192), and 13.27\u2009\u00b1\u20091.87 (range: 4-16), respectively. GLM analysis revealed a significant positive association between preparedness and both health literacy (B\u2009=\u20090.10; 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.14; p\u2009<\u20090.001) and caregiving competence (B\u2009=\u20091.01; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.37; p\u2009<\u20090.001). Compared to housewives, employed or retired family caregivers exhibited significantly higher mean preparedness scores (B\u2009=\u20092.05; 95% CI 0.16 to 3.94; p\u2009=\u20090.033). Family caregivers with illiterate patients (B = -\u00a02.29; 95% CI -\u00a04.37 to -\u00a00.21; p\u2009=\u20090.031) compared to having a university education, as well as whose patients were diagnosed within the past 12-18 months (B = -\u00a04.42; 95% CI -\u00a08.36 to -\u00a00.49; p\u2009=\u20090.028) compared to 18-24 months, demonstrated significantly lower mean preparedness scores. The positive correlation between family caregivers' preparedness for caregiving, health literacy, and caregiving competence suggests that enhancing these aspects can potentially improve family caregivers' readiness to provide effective care. The findings of this study can be used in planning educational interventions to improve preparedness for care among family caregivers of breast cancer patients. This can be helpful in reducing healthcare costs for symptom management, fostering better decision-making preparedness, managing family caregiver stress, and improving the quality of life for both family caregivers and patients.",

    "abstract": "Aggressive prostate cancer (PC) represents a significant health concern. Conventional screening methods, primarily based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, lack specificity, leading to an urgent need for more accurate diagnostic tools. This study investigates whether integrating clinical and routine blood laboratory parameters can improve the early non-invasive prediction of aggressive PC. In a pilot study of 578 patients with suspicion of PC, 28 laboratory values alongside data on family history, diet, and lifestyle were analyzed. A logistic regression classifier was developed, with model performance evaluated using repeated k-fold cross-validation on the complete dataset (n\u2009=\u2009282). Participants were categorized into healthy, moderate PC (ISUP 1-2), and aggressive PC (ISUP 3-5). Significant associations were found between PC aggressiveness and lower levels of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S) and free PSA%, as well as higher levels of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). The integration of these serum markers with clinical parameters into a new multi-stage risk classifier significantly improved the predictive accuracy for aggressive PC, outperforming PSA-only methods. The integration of DHEA-S, androstenedione, and SHBG as widely available and cost-effective novel blood biomarkers offers a more targeted, non-invasive prediction of aggressive PC. This approach could reduce reliance on invasive prostate biopsies and expensive magnetic resonance imaging.",

    "abstract": "Cell cycle protein E2 (CCNE2) is a member of the Cyclin family, known for driving tumor cell proliferation and invasion. However, the mechanism of its action in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains unclear. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between CCNE2 and cisplatin resistance and survival prognosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. We performed transcriptomic sequencing of HNSCC and HNSCC/DDP. Kaplan-Meier analysis and COX regression analysis were used to evaluate the relationship between CCNE2 expression and survival prognosis of HNSCC patients. Multiple potential biological functions of CCNE2 in HNSCC were identified using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was used to explore tumor immune infiltration. The potential mechanism of CCNE2 was explored by molecular docking and immunoprecipitation. Cell migration, cell invasion and cell proliferation assays were used to investigate the mechanism of CCNE2 in HNSCC. CCNE2 is up-regulated in HNSCC tissues and cell lines and is associated with poor prognosis. The high expression of CCNE2 in HNSCC is associated with clinical significance. GO and KEGG analysis showed that ccne2 related genes may be involved in the regulation of DNA double-strand break repair and DNA metabolic process. CCNE2 expression was positively correlated with the infiltration levels of helper T cells, Tcm cells and Th2 cells, and negatively correlated with the infiltration levels of DC, neutrophils and pDC. CCNE2 regulates the invasion, migration and proliferation of HNSCC cells by targeting MNAT1. CCNE2 also altered cisplatin resistance in HNSCC/DDP. CCNE2 may be an independent prognostic biomarker of HNSCC through MNAT1, which provides new ideas for cisplatin resistance and therapeutic targets of HNSCC.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed the severity of mental health concerns, including depression and anxiety, and identified its association with psychosocial and caregiving factors. A cross-sectional study involved 213 family caregivers of lung cancer patients was conducted between June 2023 and August 2024 at a general provincial hospital in Northern Vietnam. Mental health concerns, caregiving challenges (burden, preparedness, and readiness for surrogate decision-making) and psychosocial factors (quality of life and social support) were measured. Modified Poisson regression examined associations between these factors with mental health concerns. Approximately 37% screened positive for mental health concerns, with 29.1% and 27.2% experiencing mild-to-severe depression and anxiety, respectively. Factors positively associated with mild-to-severe depression included being female (Prevalence ratio [PR]\u2009=\u20091.79, 95%CI: 1.07, 3.01), higher caregiving burden (PR\u2009=\u20091.06, 95%CI: 1.04, 1.08) and better caregiving preparedness (PR\u2009=\u20091.34, 95%CI: 1.02, 1.75). Similarly, caregiving burden (PR\u2009=\u20091.05, 95%CI: 1.02, 1.07) was positively associated with mild-to-severe anxiety. Conversely, better quality of life was negatively associated with both mild-to-severe depression (PR\u2009=\u20090.97, 95%CI: 0.95, 0.99) and anxiety (PR\u2009=\u20090.96, 95%CI: 0.94, 0.98). Only social support from friends (PR\u2009=\u20090.87, 95%CI: 0.77, 0.98) was negatively associated with mild-to-severe anxiety. No association was observed between readiness for surrogate decision-making and either mild-to-severe depression or anxiety. This study underscores the significant prevalence of mental health concerns, with one in ten family caregivers meeting the threshold for mental health treatment. The findings advocate for routine mental health screening to enable early identification and intervention. Promoting well-being and bolstering social connections is a critical strategy to mitigate mental health concerns.",

    "abstract": "Although surgical resection combined with radiotherapy is still the preferred treatment for soft tissue sarcoma, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is becoming more popular. The goal of this research is to get a large, multicenter retrospective analysis to build a practical and validated method to predict overall survival in patients. This study was a retrospective study of 902 soft tissue sarcoma patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We used the Cox multivariate model to build a nomogram for predicting overall survival and converted it into a web-based nomogram. To identify and calibrate the model, bootstrap resampling was used to draw receiver operating characteristic curves and calibration curves, as well as to test the clinical applicability of the model by plotting decision curves. A total of 634 patients were included in the training cohort, while the remaining 268 patients were included in the validation cohort. Overall survival was significantly influenced by disease stage, age, tumor size, grade, and radiation, and nomograms were created to predict overall survival. The area under the curve for predicting overall survival at 1, 3, and 5 years in the training cohort was 0.797, 0.751, and 0.739, respectively; the area under the curve for the validation cohort was 0.726, 0.747, and 0.698, respectively. The calibration curves showed that the model performs well in terms of calibration (prediction accuracy). In addition, the decision curve analysis demonstrates the good clinical application of the model, allowing for a greater net clinical benefit. For soft tissue sarcoma patients who have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we have developed the first novel tool to accurately predict overall survival. This tool improves clinicians' ability to assess patient prognosis, enhances prognosis-based treatment decisions, and can be used as a guide for clinicians to consult with patients.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer is the fifth cause of death by cancer worldwide, second in incidence in the male population. The definition of the molecular basis of its development and the oncogenic signals driving lethality continue to be important objectives in prostate cancer research. Prior work from others and us has demonstrated that loss of PGC1\u03b1 expression results in a metabolic, signaling and transcriptional reprogramming that supports the development of metastatic disease. However, we do not fully understand the spectrum of tumor suppressive effects regulated by this co-regulator. Here we show that PGC1\u03b1 governs non-cell autonomous paracrine tumor suppression in prostate cancer. A systematic analysis of the transcriptional landscapes associated to PGC1\u03b1 loss of expression revealed that PGC1\u03b1 alters the expression of genes encoding for secreted proteins. Cell secretome studies corroborated that PGC1\u03b1-dependent ERR\u03b1 regulation in prostate cancer cells suppresses the growth of tumor cells exposed to their conditioned media, independently of androgen receptor status. The integration of in vitro and in vivo secretomics data and genetic perturbation assays revealed spermidine synthase as a transcriptional target of PGC1\u03b1 and mediator of the paracrine metabolic growth suppressive effect. Moreover, the activity of the regulatory axis PGC1\u03b1-ERR\u03b1-SRM was reflected in patients and had prognostic value. Altogether, this work provides unprecedented evidence of the non-cell autonomous suppressive role of PGC1\u03b1, which broadens the view of this co-regulator as a multifactorial tumor suppressor in prostate cancer.",

Patients with wild-type FLT3 relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML face significant therapeutic challenges due to the persistent lack of effective treatments. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying chemotherapy resistance is needed to the development of effective treatment strategies. Therefore, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying cytarabine (Ara-C) resistance and daunorubicin (DNR) tolerance in Ara-C-resistant RHI-1 cells derived from the wild-type FLT3 AML cell line SHI-1. Quantitative analysis of intracellular drug concentrations, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics showed that DNR resistance in Ara-C-resistant RHI-1 cells is driven by metabolic remodeling toward mitochondrial metabolism, upregulation of DNA repair pathways, and enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification rather than reduced drug uptake. Moreover, targeting these compensatory mechanisms, particularly the OXPHOS complex I proteins, significantly improved the efficacy of both Ara-C and DNR. Conclusively, these findings highlight mitochondrial metabolism and DNA repair as critical factors in chemotherapy resistance and offer valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets for enhancing treatment outcomes in patients with wild-type FLT3 R/R AML.",

Primary IVIG prophylaxis was defined as starting IVIG prior to first documented infection. All analyses were adjusted for immortal-time bias inherent in this grouping. A total of 225 patients were included in this analysis. Primary IVIG prophylaxis was defined as starting IVIG prior to first documented infection. The median follow-up of patients treated with and without primary IVIG prophylaxis was, 9 and 11 months, respectively. The cumulative incidence of all grade infections at 12 months with and without primary IVIG prophylaxis were 56% (95%CI 40%,78%) and 60% (95% CI 48%, 76%); p\u2009=\u20090.72, respectively. The 12-month cumulative incidence of \u2265\u2009grade 3 infections was 35% (95% CI 21%, 57%) with primary IVIG prophylaxis and 45% (95% CI 34%, 60%) without; p\u2009=\u20090.37. The median infection free survival (IFS) for all-grade infections was 7.7 (95% CI 3.3, 14) months with primary IVIG prophylaxis and 3 (95% CI 2.6, 4.5) months without (p\u2009=\u20090.021). The median \u2265\u2009grade 3 IFS was 14 (95% CI 8.8, NR) and 7.5 (95% CI 6.1, 14) months, with and without primary IVIG respectively; p\u2009=\u20090.022. Patients on primary IVIG prophylaxis had a superior progression-free-survival (PFS) [median PFS 15 vs 8 months; p\u2009=\u20090.026] and overall-survival (OS) [median OS 16 vs 44 months; p\u2009=\u20090.007]. On multivariate analysis, primary IVIG prophylaxis was independently associated with improved OS (HR\u2009=\u20090.37; p\u2009=\u20090.021), while the presence of extra-medullary (HR\u2009=\u20092.71; p\u2009=\u2009<0.001) and high-risk disease (HR\u2009=\u20091.88; p\u2009=\u20090.031) conferred poor outcomes. In recipients of BCMA-directed bsAb, IVIG supplementation was associated with an improved clinical outcome, including favorable IFS and OS.",

    "abstract": "Antigen escape relapse is a major challenge in targeted immunotherapies, including CD19- and CD22-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). To identify tumor-intrinsic factors driving antigen loss, we perform single-cell analyses on 61 B-ALL patient samples treated with CAR T cells. Here we show that low levels of IKAROS in pro-B-like B-ALL cells before CAR T treatment correlate with antigen escape. IKAROS<sup>low</sup> B-ALL cells undergo epigenetic and transcriptional changes that diminish B-cell identity, making them resemble progenitor cells. This shift leads to reduced CD19 and CD22 surface expression. We demonstrate that CD19 and CD22 expression is IKAROS dose-dependent and reversible. Furthermore, IKAROS<sup>low</sup> cells exhibit higher resistance to CD19- and CD22-targeted therapies. These findings establish a role for IKAROS as a regulator of antigens targeted by widely used immunotherapies and in the risk of antigen escape relapse, identifying it as a potential prognostic target.",

    "abstract": "Cerebrospinal fluid leak can occur after retrosigmoid craniectomy and lead to substantial patient morbidity. The aim of this study was to compare two closure techniques for vestibular schwannoma resection in terms of cerebrospinal fluid leak and other procedure-related issues. This retrospective monocentric study included patients who underwent surgery for vestibular schwannoma resection via a retrosigmoid approach by the same oto-neurosurgical team. Before 2019, the retrosigmoid approach consisted of a craniectomy and the closure involved autologous abdominal fat graft obliteration (previous procedure). After 2019, the authors performed a craniotomy and used S53P4 bioactive glass granules to close the craniotomy site (new procedure). We included 193 patients, 79 with the previous procedure and 114 the new procedure. Cerebrospinal fluid leak developed postoperatively in 3 patients with the new procedure and 14 with the previous procedure (p\u2009< 0.01). Need for surgical revision to treat the leak was lower with the new than previous procedure (1 vs 6 patients, p\u2009= 0.02) and the median length of hospital stay was reduced by 2\u00a0days with the new procedure (< 0.001). The craniotomy/bioactive glass obliteration technique was associated with less cerebrospinal fluid leak as compared with craniectomy/autologous fat graft obliteration, less revision surgery and a shorter hospital stay.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma remains an incurable tumour (median survival:\u2009~\u200915\u00a0months) and little clinical progress has been made over the past decades. Therefore, identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets is imperative. Targeting the somatostatin/cortistatin-system is considered a successful avenue for treating different tumour pathologies. Thus, we comprehensively characterized (clinically and molecularly) the expression of the somatostatin/cortistatin-system components [ligands and receptors (SSTRs)] using five cohorts of patients and tested the in-vitro therapeutic response of different SSTR-agonists\u00a0and somatostatin analogs (SSAs) in primary patient-derived glioblastoma cells. A clear downregulation of the whole somatostatin/cortistatin-system (except for SSTR5) in glioblastoma vs. non-tumour brain samples was demonstrated, with high discriminatory capacity. Moreover, poor overall-survival and critical aggressiveness-parameters (i.e., recurrence, IDH1-wildtype and G-CIMP status, classical and mesenchymal GBM-subtypes, EGFR-amplification) were robustly associated with SSTR1/SSTR2 downregulation. Notably, octreotide, pasireotide, and SSTR1/2/5-agonists treatments significantly reduced cell-proliferation in primary patient-derived GBM-cells. Molecularly, antitumour effects of octreotide/pasireotide were exerted through key signalling-factors related to glioblastoma-aggressiveness (i.e., CDKN1A-B/JAK-STAT/NF-\u03baB/TGF-\u03b2-pathways). Altogether, this study demonstrated that somatostatin/cortistatin-system is drastically altered in GBM representing a useful prognostic tool, and that SSTR-modulators might represent a potential therapeutic strategy to treat specific subsets of patients with GBM.",

    "abstract": "Chemotherapy resistance remains a major obstacle in breast cancer treatment. This study identifies DCAF13, a substrate recognition receptor of the CRL4 ubiquitin ligase complex, as a critical regulator of chemotherapy resistance through c-Myc-driven metabolic reprogramming. We found that DCAF13 expression was significantly upregulated in chemotherapy-resistant breast cancer cell lines compared to their parental counterparts. Inhibition of DCAF13 enhanced chemotherapy sensitivity, whereas its overexpression suppressed drug sensitivity. Mechanistically, DCAF13 upregulated c-Myc expression, driving metabolic reprogramming, characterized by increased glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. This metabolic shift promoted cell proliferation and resistance to chemotherapy. Clinically, DCAF13 expression correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients, particularly in advanced stages and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Our findings highlight the DCAF13-c-Myc axis as a critical mediator of chemotherapy resistance, suggesting that targeting this pathway could provide novel therapeutic strategies to overcome drug resistance in breast cancer. Further clinical studies are needed to explore the potential of DCAF13 as a therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "The advent of da Vinci robotic technology has revolutionized the surgical management of mediastinal masses. However, research on the learning curve of full-port robot-assisted mediastinal mass resection remains limited. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 74 consecutive patients who underwent full-port robot-assisted mediastinal mass resection performed by a single surgeon at our center. We performed multiple linear regression analysis to evaluate and standardize the operative time (OT). Subsequently, the cumulative sum (CUSUM) control charts were constructed to compare learning curve models derived from standardized versus nonstandardized OT data. Finally, a systematic evaluation was conducted to assess the perioperative parameters. Lesion size and intraoperative blood loss were identified via multiple linear regression as significant factors influencing the OT (P\u2009<\u20090.05), with the OT standardized using regression coefficients. A CUSUM chart based on the OT was then generated. The learning curve model based on nonstandardized operative time data demonstrated an earlier peak than that derived from standardized data. Further analysis of the standardized operative time revealed a peak in the learning curve at the 33rd case. Cases 1-33 were classified as the learning phase and cases 34-74 as the proficiency phase. The mean OT in the proficiency phase was significantly shorter, and intraoperative blood loss was notably lower than that in the learning phase (P\u2009<\u20090.05 for both). However, no significant differences were identified between the two phases for other perioperative outcomes (P\u2009>\u20090.05).",

    "abstract": "Clear cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix (CCCUC) is a rare disease, accounting for 4% to 9% of cervical adenocarcinomas. Because it is so rare, its pathogenesis is largely unknown, and the standard treatment is unclear due to a lack of prospective studies. Our aim is to investigate the clinical features, treatment, and prognosis of CCCUC. We retrospectively evaluated the clinical characteristics, treatment choices, and outcomes of 12 patients with CCCUC treated at our institution between January 2009 and July 2024. The median patient age was 62.5\u2009years (range, 14-90\u2009years). The most common stage was IB (IA, n\u2009=\u20093; IB, n\u2009=\u20094; IIB, n\u2009=\u20091; IIIC, n\u2009=\u20092; IVB, n\u2009=\u20092). Ten patients underwent surgery as initial treatment: 6 underwent radical hysterectomy plus pelvic lymphadenectomy (PLD) or sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), with or without para-aortic lymphadenectomy (PALD); 3 underwent modified radical hysterectomy plus PLD with or without PALD; and 1 underwent radical trachelectomy with SLNB as fertility-preserving surgery. All patients underwent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy except for the patient who opted for radical trachelectomy. Five patients received adjuvant treatment: 3 received platinum-based systemic chemotherapy (2 of whom had combination therapy with bevacizumab), and 2 received concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The median follow-up was 43.5\u2009months (range, 1-123\u2009months). The 5-year progression-free survival rate was 64.5%.

The physiological group was divided into five groups based on the menstrual cycle: menstrual period, proliferative phase, ovulatory phase, secretory phase, and menopausal phase. The images were analyzed using visual and quantitative measurements; quantitative analysis indicators were standardized uptake value maximum (SUVmax) and the region of interest/liver ratio (R/L value). Receiver operating characteristic (ROCs) curve was used to determine the optimal cutoff values for SUVmax and R/L value. A clinical model was established using binary logistic regression, and ROC curves were drawn to evaluate the predictive performance of the model. <b>Results:</b> The uptake of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG in the endometrium exhibited cyclical variations throughout different physiological phases, with higher uptakes observed during the menstrual and ovulation phases (SUVmax values of 6.66\u00b13.26 and 3.89\u00b11.21, respectively), which are significantly higher than those in the proliferative phase [median SUVmax of 2.54 (2.02, 3.47)], secretory phase (SUVmax of 2.55\u00b10.86), and menopausal phase [SUVmax median of 2.04 (1.69, 2.29)]. During the menstrual and ovulation phases, the radiotracer accumulation patterns were triangular in 105 cases, oval in 32 cases, and round-like in 2 cases. All 42 cases of endometrial cancer showed <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake, with radiotracer accumulation patterns being round-like in 17 cases, oval in 10 cases, triangular in 9 cases, and irregular in 6 cases. There were statistically significant differences in the shapes of radiotracer concentration between the menstrual, ovulatory periods, and endometrial carcinoma (both <i>P</i>\uff1c0.001). The SUVmax and R/L values in menstrual period and ovulatory period were significantly lower than that in endometrial carcinoma group (<i>P</i>\uff1c0.001). During the menstrual phase, the optimal cutoff values for SUVmax and R/L in distinguishing between endometrial and endometrial cancer were 12.59 and 3.81, respectively, with corresponding AUCs of 0.885 and 0.842. After incorporating endometrial uptake morphology into the model, the AUCs was improved to 0.969 and 0.948, respectively. During the ovulatory phase, the optimal cutoff values for SUVmax and R/L were 5.96 and 2.85, respectively, with AUCs of 0.984 and 0.968. After integrating endometrial uptake morphology into the model, the AUCs were increased to 0.999 and 0.998, respectively. <b>Conclusions:</b> The <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET imaging of the endometrium shows higher uptake during the menstrual and ovulatory periods, primarily triangular in shape; endometrial carcinoma uptake is significantly higher than the physiological uptake during the menstrual and ovulatory periods, mainly in circular, oval, and irregular shapes.

Gene testing and follow-up were performed. <b>Result:</b> There were 5 males and 3 females with onset ages ranging from 29 to 75 years old, median age 63.5 years. Among the patients, 5 cases were located in the trachea and 3 cases in the lungs. Under light microscopy, 5 cases were benign glomus tumors with clear boundaries, diffuse sheet or nest-like distribution, small, round or short spindle-shaped tumor cells, rounded and centered nuclei, and no obvious nuclear mitosis was seen. Two cases of glomus tumor of uncertain malignant potential showed an infiltrative growth pattern involving smooth muscle, nerves and blood vessels with necrosis and calcification, the tumor cells were more uniform in size, round or short spindle-shaped nuclei, and no obvious nuclear mitosis was seen; One case of malignant glomus tumor was seen in sarcomatous areas, lung membrane invasion and necrosis, the tumor cells were highly heterogeneous, binucleated and multinucleated, with nuclear mitoses of 20/50 high power field (HPF), and pathologic nuclear mitoses were easy to be seen.

    "abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> To analyze the epidemiological characteristics and survival rate of nasopharynx cancer (NPC) in Guangdong Province from 2011 to 2019. <b>Methods:</b> Based on the cancer registry data of Guangdong Province from 2011 to 2019, the crude rate, age-standardized rate (the standard population was the fifth Chinese national census of 2000) and age-specific rate of incidence and mortality of NPC were calculated, and the regional distribution characteristics were also explored. The average annual percentage change (AAPC) of the incidence and mortality rates were analyzed by using Joinpoint regression model. The observed survival rate was estimated by period survival method, and the expected survival rate was calculated by Ederer \u2161 method. <b>Results:</b> The crude incidence rate and age standardized incidence rate of NPC showed a decreasing trend, and the AAPC was -1.9% and -2.1%, respectively (<i>P</i>\uff1c0.05). The crude mortality rate and age standardized mortality rate of NPC also showed a decreasing trend, and the AAPC was -4.8% and -4.6%, respectively (<i>P</i>\uff1c0.05). The incidence and mortality rates are both higher in men than those in women during the nine years. The age-specific incidence rate of NPC reached its peak in the 50-64 years old age group, and the mortality rate reached its peak in the 65-74 years old age group in Guangdong province. In 2019, the age-standardized incidence rate of NPC was 9.49/100 000 (13.89/100 000 in men and 5.19/100 000 in women). The incidence and mortality of NPC varied greatly among different areas, and the areas with highest incidence and mortality rate were both in Zhaoqing. In 2020, the five-year observed survival rate of NPC in Guangdong Province was 67.2%, the 5-year relative survival rate was 75.3% and the 5-year standardized relative survival rate was 68.9%. <b>Conclusions:</b> Both the incidence and mortality rates of NPC in Guangdong province show decreasing trend, and the decreasing level of the mortality rate is higher than that of the incidence rate, but the two rates are still at high levels. The prevention and control work should focus on male, middle-aged and elderly population and Zhaoqing, Zhongshan, Foshan areas.",

    "abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> To understand the burden of cancer disease in Hebei Province in recent years and to analyze the change trend of cancer in Hebei Province from 2011 to 2020. <b>Methods:</b> The incidence and death data of cancer were collected from 38 cancer registries in Hebei Province during 2011-2020. The incidence (mortality) rate, standardized incidence (mortality) rate and composition ratio of each region, sex, and age were calculated respectively, and the incidence and death of major cancers in our province were summarized. The age-standardized morbidity (mortality) rates of China and the world population were calculated using the 2000 China standard population composition and Segi's world population composition respectively. Trend analysis of morbidity and mortality was performed and average annual percentage change (AAPC) was calculated. <b>Results:</b> In 2020, the crude cancer incidence rate and the age-standardized morbidity rate of China was 229.36/100 000 and 147.06/100 000, respectively. An estimated 171 600 new cases were reported in the province. The crude cancer mortality rate and the age-standardized mortality rates of China was 146.38/100 000 and 85.33/100 000. The estimated number of deaths in the province is 108 900. In the cancer registration areas of Hebei Province, 84% of all cancer patients occurred in people 50 years of age and older. From 2011 to 2020, the incidence and mortality of cancer in Hebei Province showed a decreasing trend. The AAPC was -4.2% (<i>P</i>\uff1c0.001), which decreased from 206.61/100 000 in 2011 to 143.74/100 000 in 2020. The world standard mortality rate of cancer was 147.69/100 000 in 2011, and decreased to 84.79/100 000 in 2020. The AAPC was -5.7% (<i>P</i>\uff1c0.001). The world-standard incidence and mortality of lung cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer and colorectal cancer decreased from 2011 to 2020. The AAPCs of the world-standard incidence were -4.0%, -12.3%, -9.4%, -6.0% and -1.6%, respectively. The AAPCs of the world-standard mortality were -4.9%, -11.3%, -8.5%, -5.7% and -3.3%, which were statistically significant. The incidence of thyroid cancer increased rapidly, the AAPC of which was 9.7% (<i>P</i>\uff1c0.001). The rates of female breast cancer and male prostate cancer in Hebei Province were stable. <b>Conclusions:</b> The world-standard incidence and mortality of cancer in Hebei Provincial cancer registries areas show a downward trend from 2011 to 2020. However, the cancer incidence and mortality in Hebei Province are still at high levels. It's necessary to strengthen cancer prevention and control in Hebei Province, improve the awareness of cancer prevention and control in the whole society, and promote the concept of tertiary cancer prevention to reduce the cancer burden in Hebei Province.",

    "abstract": "<b>Objective:</b> To analyze the incidence, mortality, survival patterns, and distribution characteristics of modifiable risk factors for colorectal cancer in selected global regions. <b>Methods:</b> Secondary analysis was conducted using data from the GLOBOCAN database and previous literature. We described the number of cases and age-standardized rates (ASRs) of incidence and mortality for colorectal cancer in China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and globally in 2022 and 2020, with gender-stratified analysis. ASRs were calculated using Segi's world standard population. Temporal trends in 5-year net survival rates were compared across three periods (2000-2004, 2005-2009, 2010-2014) among countries. Regional distribution differences in colorectal cancer deaths attributable to modifiable risk factors by gender were assessed in China. <b>Results:</b> In 2022, global colorectal cancer incidence and mortality were estimated at 1.926 million new cases and 904 000 deaths. China accounted for 27% of both global incidence (517 000 cases) and mortality (240 000 deaths). China's age-standardized incidence rate (20.1 per 100 000) was lower than those of the United States (27.0 per 100 000) and the UK (30.9 per 100 000). However, China's mortality rate (8.6 per 100 000) exceeded that of the US (7.9 per 100 000) but was lower than the UK (11.8 per 100 000). Compared to 2020, China demonstrated significant mortality reductions in 2022: males declined from 14.8 to 10.9 per 100 000, females from 9.4 to 6.5 per 100 000. Five-year net survival rates in China improved across periods for colon cancer (51.4%, 55.6%, 57.6%) and rectal cancer (49.5%, 52.5%, 56.9%), yet remained consistently lower than US and UK rates. Modifiable risk factors contributed to 45.1% of male and 41.4% of female colorectal cancer deaths in China, with marked regional disparities. <b>Conclusions:</b> China exhibits higher colorectal cancer incidence and mortality than global averages, with survival gaps persisting compared to developed nations. Regionally tailored comprehensive prevention strategies are essential to reduce disease burden through risk factor modification and optimized clinical management.",

    "title": "[Research progress of tumor neoantigen-specific adoptive cellular immunotherapy].",
    "abstract": "Tumour neoantigen sprimarily refer to a specific group of tumour antigens derived from tumour mutant proteins, but also including antigens generated by the oncogenic viruses integrated into the genome, which are not expressed by normal cells in the human body but are specifically expressed in tumor cells, and are capable of triggering the tumour-specific cellular and humoral immunity in the host. In recent years, significant advances in tumor immunotherapy such as therapeutic oncology vaccines, and adoptive cell therapy (ACT) have been acquired. However, standalone tumor therapeutic vaccines exhibit several drawbacks. They possess low immunogenicity, face a substantial tumor burden, and are highly susceptible to the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Consequently, when applied in isolation during clinical practice, their therapeutic efficacy remains limited. Compared with immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and tumor vaccines, ACT is less affected by the immunosuppressive microenvironment in the body and can generate a sufficient number of killer cells. The crux of ACT lies in the generation of immunogenic tumor-specific killer cells. Neoantigens enhance the immunogenicity and anti-tumor specificity of ACT. Among them, the ACT targeting mutant gene mutations, including <i>ERBB2IP</i>, <i>KRAS</i> and <i>TP53</i>, as well as those derived from viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human papillomavirus (HPV), is primarily summarized. Moreover, the existing issues of neoantigen-specific ACT and corresponding countermeasures are summarized and discussed.",

In recent years, targeted angiogenesis treatment strategies have gradually become an important direction in cancer treatment. Single-cell sequencing technology can provide new insights into targeted angiogenesis by providing a deeper understanding of the heterogeneity of tumour endothelial cells and exploring the interactions between endothelial cells and surrounding cells in the tumour microenvironment. Here, we systematically review the research progress in endothelial cell pathophysiology and its endothelial\u2012mesenchymal transition and illustrate the heterogeneity of endothelial cells from a single-cell perspective. Finally, we examine the contributions of different cell types within the tumour microenvironment in relation to tumour angiogenesis, as well as the latest progress and strategies in targeted angiogenesis therapy, hoping to provide useful insights into the clinical application of antiangiogenic treatment. Furthermore, a summary of the present progress in the development of potential angiogenesis inhibitors and the ongoing clinical trials for combination therapies is provided. KEY POINTS: Angiogenesis plays a key role in tumour progression, invasion and metastasis, so strategies targeting angiogenesis are gradually becoming an important direction in cancer therapy. Interactions between endothelial cells and stromal cells and immune cells in the tumour microenvironment are significant in angiogenesis. The application of antiangiogenic immunotherapy and nanotechnology in antiangiogenic therapy provides a vital strategy for prolonging the survival of cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is a potential treatment for relapsed/refractory (R/R) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL). The combination of targeted therapeutic strategies, particularly bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor zanubrutinib and programmed death-1 inhibitor tislelizumab, may improve clinical outcomes and modulate the tumour microenvironment (TME). We studied patients with R/R LBCL who received response-adapted zanubrutinib plus tislelizumab upon CD19 CAR T-cell therapy between June 2021 and March 2023. Patients were treated with zanubrutinib daily from leukapheresis to day 28 post-infusion; those achieving complete response continued zanubrutinib monotherapy for 3 months, while partial responders received combined zanubrutinib for 3 months and tislelizumab for up to 2 years. We evaluated the overall response rate (ORR), complete response rate (CRR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. DNA sequencing and RNA sequencing were performed on available tumour samples to analyse genetic aberrations and TME characteristics. A total of 54 patients with LBCL were included, with a median follow-up of 23.6 months. The ORR at day 28, month 3, and month 6 were 94% (CRR 66%), 87% (CRR 80%), and 80% (CRR 76%), respectively. The 2-year PFS and 2-year OS rates were 68% and 76%, respectively. Median PFS and median OS were not reached. Grade \u2265 3 cytokine release syndrome occurred in 9% of patients, with no grade \u2265 3 neurotoxicity observed. Genomic and transcriptomic data indicated that this regimen was effective across genetic subtypes and abrogated T-cell exhaustion within the TME. However, tumour-infiltrating M2 macrophages with dysregulated lipid metabolism were associated with poor clinical outcome. Response-adapted zanubrutinib and tislelizumab potentially enhances the efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy with a favourable safety profile in R/R LBCL, effectively counteracting T-cell exhaustion. Future studies should focus on targeting M2 macrophages by reprogramming lipid metabolism to further attenuate the immunosuppressive TME. Response-adapted zanubrutinib plus tislelizumab potentially enhances the efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy for R/R LBCL with acceptable safety profile. This regimen functions independently of genetic subtypes, rendering it more applicable for clinical practice with CAR T-cell therapy. This regimen effectively abrogates T-cell exhaustion, but fails to overcome the immunosuppressive effects of M2 macrophages, providing a rationale for remodelling TME to optimise CAR T-cell therapy.",

    "title": "SCAPAS-LungCancer-improving supportive care for patients surgically treated for non-small cell lung cancer: protocol for a prospective, longitudinal, observational and exploratory multicentre study.",
    "abstract": "Despite global advances in lung cancer treatment, challenges persist in symptom management and supportive care, particularly as the incidence of early-stage diagnoses rises. Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) face symptom burdens compounded by physical, psychological and social factors, alongside the concealment of early-stage symptoms. Research on symptom management in patients with NSCLC remains limited, with a lack of studies exploring patient experiences and clinical management strategies. Moreover, attention to late effects highlights the need for personalised care interventions to address long-term outcomes. The SCAPAS-LungCancer study aims to bridge these gaps by enhancing our understanding of NSCLC symptomatology, late effects and quality of life. The study seeks to identify patients with multiple symptoms and late effects, offering insights for future personalised care interventions to improve patient outcomes and overall well-being. The study employs a multiple-methods approach encompassing qualitative and quantitative investigations to comprehensively explore symptomatology, patient experiences and treatment outcomes in patients with NSCLC undergoing surgical treatment. A prospective, longitudinal, observational and exploratory design is adopted. A longitudinal qualitative study, including individual interviews and ethnographic fieldwork, will be conducted to explore patients' experiences and interactions with clinicians on symptoms and late effects. Additionally, consecutive newly diagnosed patients with NSCLC scheduled for surgery will be recruited in a prospective questionnaire study using patient-reported outcomes. Eligible patients will complete self-reported measures assessing physical and psychosocial symptom burden and late effects, quality of life, social support and unmet needs at baseline and multiple follow-up points post-surgery over a 2-year period. Socio-demographic and medical characteristics are also collected. The study is approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (journal no: 2022-737) and conducted in accordance with Danish Ethics Research Committee guidelines and the Helsinki II Declaration. Participants will provide written informed consent. The results will be reported in peer-reviewed journals.",

    "abstract": "To assess the prevalence of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and their associated factors among the caregivers of children diagnosed with cancer in Oman and explore the changes in psychological outcomes over time. A multicentre, prospective, cohort study. The National Oncology Centre of the Royal Hospital, the Sultan Qaboos University Hospital and the Sultan Qaboos Comprehensive Cancer Care and Research Centre in Muscat, Oman. Caregivers of Omani children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer at the three primary cancer referral centres in Oman. Validated Arabic versions of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised were used to screen for symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD, respectively. The first assessment (T1) was conducted any time within the first 3\u2009months of the child's diagnosis, while the second assessment (T2) was conducted 3-6 months after T1. Multivariate linear regression models were used to investigate the association between socio-demographic and clinical characteristics and average anxiety, depression and PTSD scores. Of the 92 caregivers of Omani children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer, 45.7%, 53.3%, 45.7% and 68.5% exhibited state anxiety, trait anxiety, depression and PTSD at T1. Subsequently, prevalence rates of these conditions decreased to 32.6%, 42.4%, 33.7% and 55.4%, respectively, at T2. Between T1 and T2, the prevalence of state anxiety decreased significantly, as did average state anxiety and PTSD scores (p<0.05). According to the univariate analysis, the child's age and awareness of their diagnosis correlated with caregiver depression scores (p<0.05). Moreover, the child's gender was associated with both caregiver anxiety and depression scores (p<0.05). Mothers reported significantly higher depression scores compared with other caregivers (p=0.029). At T2, the type of cancer treatment received by the child was associated with caregiver anxiety and depression scores (p<0.05). At T2, a linear regression analysis showed significant positive associations between state anxiety scores and caregiver education level (\u03b2=0.196; p<0.001) and between trait anxiety scores and caregiver gender (\u03b2=0.096; p=0.029). Depression scores were significantly negatively affected by the child's age at T1 (\u03b2=-0.572; p=0.001) and the child's gender at T2 (\u03b2=-0.119; p=0.018). Family income was negatively associated with caregiver PTSD scores at T2 (\u03b2=-0.094; p=0.049). Caregivers of Omani children and adolescents with cancer, especially mothers, are likely to suffer from anxiety, depression or PTSD. Offering additional psychological support, such as counselling services, to the caregivers of children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer is recommended to reduce psychological distress and address potential mental health challenges in a timely manner.",

    "abstract": "The KEYNOTE-966 study demonstrated that pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy is more effective than chemotherapy alone as first-line treatment for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC). However, the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab combined with chemotherapy in the USA and China remains uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy compared with placebo plus chemotherapy from the perspective of US and Chinese payers. Markov models with three health states were developed to simulate the process of advanced BTC. Cost data were obtained from available databases and published literature in the US scenario, and from local institutions from the China scenario. Utility values were derived from previous studies. Primary outcomes included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). In the US scenario, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy increased costs by US$97,222.13, compared with chemotherapy alone, with a gain of 0.12 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of US$810\u2009184.42 per QALY. In the China scenario, the ICER was $360\u2009933.50 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses indicated the costs of pembrolizumab had the greatest impact on the model in both scenarios. Further analyses suggested that the optimal price of pembrolizumab in the USA would be nearly US$10.33\u2009/mg, while a price reduction of over 90% would be required for the combined therapy to be cost-effective for patients in China. Based on the willingness-to-pay threshold set at three times the gross domestic product per capita, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is not a cost-effective option for patients with advanced BTC in either the USA or China. Significant price reduction for pembrolizumab may be necessary to achieve an acceptable ICER. NCT04003636; postresults.",

    "abstract": "The high rate of chronic hepatitis, including hepatitis B, C and D, in Mongolia creates a large health burden of advanced liver disease. This includes liver failure and the highest incidence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide. In the present study, we histopathologically examined 69 recent cases of HCC from the Mongolian National Center for Pathology, which collects specimens from across the country. The background liver histology of HCC exhibited a bimodal distribution, with one peak corresponding to advanced liver fibrosis and another to mild liver fibrosis. The fibrosis severity negatively correlated with age. Additionally, the frequency of poorly differentiated tumors was significantly higher in the HCC with early stage of fibrosis. A comparison of the pathological characteristics of HCC in urban and rural areas showed that poorly differentiated tumors were highly prevalent in urban areas. The characteristics of HCC in Mongolia are different from those in other countries, suggesting that the causes of liver disease are not only related to viruses but also other factors that depend on the region.

We previously showed that fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), a major adipokine of mature adipocytes, promotes the progression of prostate cancer cell growth and invasion. In this report, we present lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR) as a newly identified binding partner for FABP4. Their binding induced Akt phosphorylation, whereas LSR knockdown (KD) failed to phosphorylate Akt. Intraosseous injection of LSR-KD prostate cancer cells showed smaller areas of intraosseous tumor, lower Ki-67 labeling indices, and lower numbers of phospho-Akt-positive cancer cells compared with control prostate cancer cells. Moreover, the contact coculture of prostate cancer cells with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) promoted FABP4 secretion by BMSCs. Our findings indicated that FABP4-mediated prostate cancer cell progression was regulated by cellular signaling via FABP4-LSR binding in the bone microenvironment. J. Med.

    "abstract": "Appendiceal goblet cell adenocarcinomas (GCA) are rare. Most patients who undergo appendectomy have acute appendicitis. The detection of synchronous colorectal cancer (SCRC) has increased with advances in diagnostic imaging and endoscopic examinations. However, only two cases of SCRC, including appendiceal GCA, have been reported to date. We recently encountered an extremely rare case of SCRC, involving appendiceal GCA, ascending colon cancer (ACC), and sigmoid colon cancer (SCC). Herein, we present this case and provide a discussion on the relevant literature. A 69-year-old man presented to our hospital with right lower abdominal pain. Based on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT), the patient was diagnosed with SCRC and acute appendicitis caused by appendiceal neoplasm and ACC. The patient underwent emergency laparotomy, and right colectomy with lymph node dissection (LD). Intraoperatively, we palpated the remaining segment of the colorectum whenever possible and incidentally detected SCC. Therefore, sigmoid resection with LD was suggested. When treating acute appendicitis, it is important to consider the possibility of an extremely rare appendiceal tumor as the cause. If possible, CE-CT should be performed to ensure appropriate image interpretation during an unlikely SCRC event. J. Med. Invest. 72 : 194-201, February, 2025.",

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed wall thickening of the middle thoracic esophagus and an enlarged abdominal lymph nodes and a spiculated pulmonary shadow 25\u00d720 mm in size in right lower lobe that was highly suspected as a primary lung cancer. Preoperative chemotherapy was introduced due to advanced esophageal cancer, both the esophageal tumor and the pulmonary lesion were found to be shrunk. Even after a detailed examination, the shadow in the right lower lobe of the lung could not be ruled out for malignancy, a simultaneous surgery was conducted. The patient underwent S10 segmentectomy followed by subtotal esophagectomy and the posterior mediastinal route reconstruction using a gastric conduit. Gastrografin radiography revealed stasis of the reconstructed gastric conduit on postoperative day (POD) 8. CT and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed that the gastric conduit was pulled into the right thoracic cavity caused by pulmonary resection and developed inflammatory changes, causing DGCE. The DGCE eventually improved with conservative treatment and the patient was discharged on POD 68. J. Med. Invest. 72 : 189-193, February, 2025.",

    "abstract": "Sarcoma Meth A is widely used in the field of immunology and oncology study. We found that a mutant cell line, Meth A (mMeth A), was rejected in an in vivo subcutaneous challenge in BALB / c mice. mMeth A cells were not rejected in athymic BALB / c-nu / nu mice and CD8+ cell-depleted BALB / c mice, suggesting that CD8+ cells are required for rejection of mMeth A cells. Microarray analysis showed that melanoma antigen (MAg) was one of the most elevated genes in mMeth A cells. Indeed, quantitative gene expression analysis showed that the expression level of MAg in mMeth A cells was one hundred-times higher than that in Meth A cells. We constructed two types of expression vector coding the MAg gene sequence corresponding to 788-1257 and 1611-2043 and immunized mice with these genes by intramuscular injection. Immunization of a plasmid expressing the Mag 788-1257 gene protected the mice from in vivo Meth A challenge as evaluated by tumor volume and survival rate. The results reveal that MAg is a potential vaccine candidate antigen against Meth A tumors. J. Med. Invest. 72 : 161-166, February, 2025.",

    "abstract": "The oral and gut microbiomes are linked to prognosis in colorectal cancer patients undergoing surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy. Dysbiosis in the oral microbiome can lead to tooth decay, periodontitis, and gingivitis, resulting in tooth loss. This study examined the relationship between tooth count and chemotherapy outcomes in colorectal cancer patients. This retrospective cohort study involved 42 patients receiving chemotherapy for unresectable advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer at Tokushima University Hospital between October 2016 and December 2021. Prior to chemotherapy, dental panoramic radiographs were taken to determine tooth count. Patients were grouped based on the number of teeth (\u226517 vs. \u226416), and overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and adverse events were compared. Patients with \u226416 teeth had significantly worse OS than those with \u226517 teeth (p = 0.024). PFS tended to be worse in patients with \u226416 teeth, albeit without significance (p = 0.097). The incidence of various adverse events did not differ between the groups. Anemia was the most common adverse event in patients with \u226416 teeth. Conversely, neutropenia was the most common adverse event in patients with \u226517 teeth. The number of teeth could be easily examined prognostic factor for chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. J.

    "abstract": "IntroductionPapillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) generally has a favorable prognosis, yet advanced PTC has higher recurrence and mortality risks. This study constructs and validates a competing risk model for cause-specific mortality (CSM) in advanced PTC.MethodsStage III-IV PTC cases (AJCC 7th edition) from the SEER database (2010-2015) were analyzed. Patients were split into training and validation sets (7:3). Univariate and multivariate analyses identified independent CSM predictors, forming the basis of a risk prediction nomogram. Model accuracy was evaluated via the C-index and calibration curve.ResultsA total of 11\u00a0913 advanced PTC cases were analyzed. Competing risk model analysis unraveled that age, race, sex, grade, stage, T stage, M stage, surgery, chemotherapy, and tumor size were risk factors for CSM in advanced PTC. The AUC values of the constructed nomogram in predicting 3-, 5-, and 8-year survival were 0.931 (95%CI 0.909-0.953), 0.915 (95%CI 0.897-0.933), and 0.902 (95%CI 0.883-0.92) in the training set, and 0.948 (95%CI 0.916-0.981), 0.93 (95 % CI 0.903-0.957), and 0.917 (95%CI 0.891-0.943) in the validation cohort, respectively. The C-index of the nomogram for advanced PTC was 0.908 and 0.921 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The calibration curve unveiled that the predicted estimates by the model were basically congruent with the observed values, suggesting a high degree of calibration.ConclusionThe competing risk model offers a reliable tool for assessing prognosis in advanced PTC, supporting personalized treatment and risk management in clinical practice.",

    "title": "Advances and Challenges in Cervical Cancer: From Molecular Mechanisms and Global Epidemiology to Innovative Therapies and Prevention Strategies.",
    "abstract": "BackgroundIn the global scenario of public health, cervical cancer poses a major threat with high mortality rates, especially in women. New incidence cases and prevalence vary across different regions, as recently shown by GLOBOCAN data. The development of cervical cancer is primarily due to persistent infection by high-risk genotypes of human papillomavirus (HPV), which is a multifaceted process that is influenced by genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors.PurposeThe goal of this study is to thoroughly investigate cervical cancer, including its etiology, molecular mechanisms, progression, diagnosis strategies, and current therapies. This review further highlights the transformative power of HPV vaccination and screening programs in curbing the disease's burden and potentially promising novel approaches like immunotherapy and targeted therapy.Research DesignThis is a narrative review article that summarizes previous literatures regarding cervical cancer in terms of molecular mechanism, etiology, clinical developments, and prevention.Study SampleThe review encompassed studies from diverse sources, including experimental, observational, and clinical research published between 1992 and 2025.Data Collection and/or AnalysisData were collected through comprehensive literature searches using databases such as PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library with defined inclusion and exclusion criteria.ResultsNonetheless, there are gaps in research and controversies regarding vaccine coverage, screening practices, and treatment accessibility for poor populations. Precision medicine trends are emerging along with new biomarkers for early detection and personalized treatment, which also form part of this discussion. Key findings include the critical role of prevention measures in controlling the global impact of cervical cancer.ConclusionsThe paper synthesizes the existing knowledge and identifies gaps that require further research, which is significant in augmenting prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cervical cancer towards addressing its public health implications worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is an age-related condition associated with increased mortality among patients with cancer. CHIP mutations with high variant-allele frequencies can be detected in tumors, a phenomenon we term tumor-infiltrating clonal hematopoiesis (TI-CH). The frequency of TI-CH and its effect on tumor evolution are unclear. We characterized CHIP and TI-CH in 421 patients with early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from the TRACERx study and in 49,351 patients from the MSK-IMPACT pan-cancer cohort. We studied the association of TI-CH with survival and disease recurrence and evaluated the functional effect of <i>TET2</i>-mutant CHIP on the biologic features of lung tumors. Among patients with NSCLC, 42% of those with CHIP had TI-CH. TI-CH independently predicted an increased risk of death or recurrence, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23 to 2.63) as compared with the absence of CHIP and an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.62 (95% CI, 1.02 to 2.56) as compared with CHIP in the absence of TI-CH. Among patients with solid tumors, 26% of those with CHIP had TI-CH. TI-CH conferred a risk of death from any cause that was 1.17 times (95% CI, 1.06 to 1.29) as high as the risk with CHIP in the absence of TI-CH. <i>TET2</i> mutations were the strongest genetic predictor of TI-CH; such mutations enhanced monocyte migration to lung tumor cells, fueled a myeloid-rich tumor microenvironment in mice, and resulted in the promotion of tumor organoid growth. TI-CH increased the risk of disease recurrence or death among patients with NSCLC and the risk of death from any cause among patients with solid tumors. TI-CH remodeled the tumor immune microenvironment and accelerated tumor organoid growth, findings that support a role for an aging-related hematologic clonal proliferation in cancer evolution.

    "abstract": "Neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase gene fusions are oncogenic drivers of various solid tumors. Larotrectinib is a highly selective tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) inhibitor approved for patients with TRK fusion cancer on the basis of single-arm trials. This study was a matched comparative effectiveness study of larotrectinib in clinical trials versus standard of care (SOC) in the real-world (RW) setting. Adult patients with advanced/metastatic TRK fusion non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, thyroid cancer, or salivary gland carcinoma were included. Deduplicated data from RW patients were from US and ex-US data sources. Patients in the larotrectinib cohort (pooled data from three trials, ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT02122913, NCT02576431, and NCT02637687) were matched 1:1 to RW patients on the basis of tumor type and line of therapy (LOT). A propensity score (weighting) model was used to balance key characteristics between cohorts. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). In total, 164 patients were matched 1:1 on tumor type and LOT (82 in each cohort). Balance in the baseline covariates was achieved after weighting. Larotrectinib-treated patients had longer OS (median, not reached [NR] <i>v</i> 37.2 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.44 [95% CI, 0.23 to 0.83]), time to next treatment (median, NR <i>v</i> 10.6 months; HR, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.13 to 0.38]), duration of therapy (median, 30.8 <i>v</i> 3.4 months; HR, 0.23 [95% CI, 0.15 to 0.33]), and progression-free survival (median, 36.8 <i>v</i> 5.2 months; HR, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.18 to 0.46]) compared with RW patients after propensity score weighting. In TRK fusion cancers, treatment with larotrectinib was associated with longer OS and prolonged time to event compared with SOC in all categories measured. These RW data provide context to support larotrectinib effectiveness in this population.",

We analyze the role of germline <i>DICER1</i> status in outcomes of ovarian SLCT. Patients with SLCT were enrolled in the International Pleuropulmonary Blastoma/<i>DICER1</i> Registry and/or the International Ovarian and Testicular Stromal Tumor Registry. Medical records were systematically abstracted, and those with known germline <i>DICER1</i> status were selected for analysis. Of 162 patients with SLCT, 60% had a germline <i>DICER1</i> pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variant. The adjusted 3-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 87.2% (95% CI, 79.4 to 95.8) for patients with a germline <i>DICER1</i> P/LP variant compared with 78.1% (95% CI, 66.4 to 91.9) for those without a germline <i>DICER1</i> P/LP variant (<i>P</i> = .043).

Previous/concurrent and subsequent neoplasms were rare among those without a germline <i>DICER1</i> P/LP variant. This cohort study of patients with SLCT demonstrated that those with germline <i>DICER1</i> P/LP variants had superior RFS and OS even when adjusting for other prognostic factors.

    "abstract": "There are scant data on patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) in real-world settings with limited access to HER2-targeted therapy. This was a retrospective analysis of patients with nonmetastatic, HER2-positive breast cancer treated with NAT between January 2014 and December 2018 to determine factors affecting pathologic complete response (pCR), event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS). The cohort comprised 1,004 patients with a median age of 47 years, 533 (53.1%) with clinical T3/T4 tumors, 466 (46.4%) with clinical N2/3 status, and 527 (52.5%) with hormone receptor-positive disease. Trastuzumab was given to 528 (52.6%) patients in the neoadjuvant setting and 711 (70.8%) patients in neoadjuvant and/or postoperative settings. pCR was achieved in 226 (22.5%) patients; the 5-year EFS in the whole cohort, pCR group, and no-pCR group was 63.5% (95% CI, 60.36 to 66.63), 86.1% (95% CI, 81.59 to 90.60), and 57% ([95% CI, 53.47 to 60.52]; <i>P</i> < .001), respectively. In multivariable analysis in the full cohort, smaller tumor size (cT1/T2 <i>v</i> cT3/T4), higher grade (III <i>v</i> II), hormone receptor-negative status, and use of neoadjuvant HER2-targeted therapy were significantly associated with higher pCR, and smaller tumor size (cT1/T2 <i>v</i> cT3/T4), lower node involvement (cN0/N1 <i>v</i> cN2/N3), achievement of pCR, and receiving trastuzumab were significantly associated with higher EFS and OS. In a setting with constrained access to HER2-targeted therapy, lower clinical tumor burden and receiving trastuzumab were significantly associated with increased pCR and survival in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer treated with NAT.

    "abstract": "Despite rising cancer incidence and mortality in Saudi Arabia, access to radiotherapy (RT) services is limited in some regions. This study aimed to examine the travel burdens of RT patients and assess the benefits of hypofractionated RT (HFRT). This multicenter retrospective study included patients with breast cancer (BC) and prostate cancer (PC) treated with HFRT (26 Gy/5 fractions for BC and 60 Gy/20 fractions for PC) between 2020 and 2024. Patient data were collected from electronic records, and an online questionnaire assessed experiences and financial burdens. Google Maps determined the shortest driving distance from patients' residences to our RT center. Descriptive statistics compared accommodation, transportation costs, and time expenditure for shorter versus longer RT courses. A survey of 153 out of 187 patients (average age 57 years for BC, 70 years for PC) revealed significant travel burdens. Notably, 43% traveled from outside Jeddah, averaging 415 km, compared with 17.9 km for those within Jeddah. HFRT offered substantial transportation cost-savings, estimated at $101 in US dollars (USD) for patients with BC (an additional $133 (USD) for those outside Jeddah) and $213 (USD) for patients with PC (an additional $320 (USD) for those outside Jeddah). Median accommodation cost-savings were $733 (USD) for BC and $1,600 (USD) for PC. Median time-savings were 9.25 hours for BC and 30 hours for PC. All patients were satisfied with the treatment duration, with 42% preferring the shorter hospital stay and 8% citing financial reasons. Patients with cancer in Saudi Arabia travel significant distances for RT. HFRT using shorter RT courses reduces patient-related costs, enhances satisfaction, and may improve access by addressing logistical challenges.",

    "abstract": "Febrile neutropenia (FN) is a common cancer complication in children. A growing body of evidence suggests that home-based care with oral antibiotics is safe and effective in carefully selected children with low-risk (LR) FN. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of oral levofloxacin versus oral amoxicillin-clavulanate/ciprofloxacin in the management of LR-FN in children with cancer over a time horizon of 7 days from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) perspective. This is a randomized controlled study conducted at the NCI from December 2021 to September 2022, including children and adolescents age between 3 and 18 years who presented to the emergency room with LR-FN criteria with the exclusion of patients younger than 3 years and patients with Down syndrome. One hundred LR-FN episodes were enrolled in each arm. Patient demographics, microbiologic data, and outcomes were collected at different time points. A decision analytic model was created to compare the two treatment strategies. The outcome measures included quality-adjusted FN episodes, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Levofloxacin was a safe and effective treatment option for LR-FN. It proved to be the dominant strategy against amoxicillin-clavulanate/ciprofloxacin with an incremental quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of 0.0001 and a lower cost of 62.4996 Egyptian pounds (EGPs) in the treatment of home-based LR-FN with a willingness to pay a threshold of 77,520 EGPs per QALY (1 gross domestic product/capita). For the treatment of FN in pediatric patients with cancer, levofloxacin offers a cost-saving option with improved survival benefits over a 7-day time horizon from the NCI perspective. These findings will help health care decisions regarding the allocation of health care system resources to improve supportive care for patients with LR-FN.",

This case stands out due to its presentation with severe refractory hypoglycemia, the location of the tumor in the abdomen, and vertebral invasion, given that most solitary fibrous tumors are found in the lungs and originate from the pleura. Uncommon causes of hypoglycemia in non-diabetic patients should be considered, such as Doege-Potter syndrome.",

    "title": "[Association of T CD3+/T CD8+ lymphocytes in lymphatic and perineural infiltration in colorectal cancer].",
    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common and lethal neoplasia in the world. Key prognostic factors include lymphovascular and perineural infiltration, which negatively affect the disease by increasing the risk of metastasis. Studies indicate that low levels of CD8+ and CD3+ T cells may be associated with early metastasis. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of preoperative serum cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8+ and CD3+) with lymphatic and perineural infiltration in colorectal cancer. Prospective, cross-sectional, analytical study on cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD8+ and CD3+). Descriptive statistics, measures of central tendency and dispersion for quantitative variables, frequency and percentage for qualitative variables were used. The samples obtained were associated with the presence of lymphovascular or perineural infiltration. 37 patients were included, with a mean age of 58 \u00b1 10.9 years; 24 (64.8%) were female. 16 (43.2%) were diagnosed with malignant colon neoplasms, and 21 (56.7%) with malignant rectal tumors. Lymphovascular infiltration was found in 13 (35.1%) and 18 (48.6%) perineural infiltrates. CD8+ T lymphocyte levels were 219 cells/AL \u00b1 140.5 cells/AL, and 16 (43.2%) had low levels. CD3+ T lymphocytes averaged with 943 cells/uL \u00b1 640.4 cells/AL, and 16 (43.2%) had low levels. Histopathologically we found an association between the serum level of CD3+ and CD8+ T cells and lymphovascular and perineural infiltration. Additional research has to be done to strengthen the results obtained.",

    "title": "In vivo functional screens reveal <i>KEAP1</i> loss as a driver of chemoresistance in small cell lung cancer.",
    "abstract": "Exquisitely chemosensitive initially, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) exhibits dismal outcomes owing to rapid transition to chemoresistance. Elucidating the genetic underpinnings has been challenging owing to limitations with cellular models. As SCLC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models mimic therapeutic responses, we perform genetic screens in chemosensitive PDX models to identify drivers of chemoresistance. cDNA overexpression screens identify <i>MYC</i>, <i>MYCN</i>, and <i>MYCL</i>, while CRISPR deletion screens identify <i>KEAP1</i> loss as driving chemoresistance. Deletion of <i>KEAP1</i> switched a chemosensitive SCLC PDX model to become chemoresistant and resulted in sensitivity to inhibition of glutamine metabolism. Data from the IMpower133 clinical trial revealed ~6% of patients with extensive-stage SCLC exhibit <i>KEAP1</i> genetic alterations, with activation of a KEAP1/NRF2 transcriptional signature associated with reduced survival upon chemotherapy treatment. While roles for KEAP1/NRF2 have been unappreciated in SCLC, our genetic screens revealed KEAP1 loss as a driver of chemoresistance, while patient genomic analyses demonstrate clinical importance.",

    "title": "Intratumoral self-assembly of renal-clearable gold nanoparticles as precise photothermal nanomedicine for liver tumor therapy.",
    "abstract": "Noninvasive photothermal therapy (PTT) for cancer with photothermal agents (PTAs) has recently achieved success in both preclinical and clinical trials. However, traditional PTAs tend to nonspecifically accumulate in normal liver tissue, hampering their use in PTT of liver tumors. By taking advantage of extremely low liver accumulation from ultrasmall renal-clearable gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), we report a biosafe therapeutic PTT strategy to treat liver tumors precisely through the intratumoral self-assembly of renal-clearable AuNPs at the tumor site via host-guest interactions. After active tumor targeting from the host AuNPs functionalized with both cyclo (Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-Cys) and cyclodextrin, the guest AuNPs functionalized with both pH-responsive doxorubicin and adamantane are designed to precisely trigger intratumoral self-assembly, enhancing both PTT and chemotherapy toward the liver tumor microenvironment. This smart design principle generates a precise therapeutic action toward liver tumors without causing any noticeable heating effect or damage to the surrounding normal liver tissue.",

    "title": "Acute BRCAness induction and AR pathway blockage through CDK12/7/9 degradation enhances PARP inhibitor sensitivity in prostate cancer.",
    "abstract": "Current treatments for advanced prostate cancer (PCa) primarily target the androgen receptor (AR) pathway. However, the emergence of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and resistance to AR pathway inhibitors (APPIs) remains ongoing challenges. Here, we present BSJ-5-63, a proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) targeting cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) CDK12, CDK7, and CDK9, offering a multipronged approach to CRPC therapy. BSJ-5-63 degrades CDK12, diminishing BRCA1 and BRCA2 expression and inducing a sustained \"BRCAness\" state. This sensitizes cancer cells to PARP inhibitors (PARPis) regardless of their homologous recombination repair (HRR) status. Furthermore, CDK7 and CDK9 degradation attenuates AR signaling, enhancing its therapeutic efficacy. Preclinical studies, including both in vitro and in vivo CRPC models, demonstrate that BSJ-5-63 exerts potent antitumor activity in both AR-positive and AR-negative setting. This study introduces BSJ-5-63 as a promising therapeutic agent that addresses both DNA repair and AR signaling mechanisms, with potential benefits for a board patient population.",

    "title": "Pharmacologic degradation of WDR5 suppresses oncogenic activities of SS18::SSX and provides a therapeutic of synovial sarcoma.",
    "abstract": "Cancer-causing aberrations recurrently target the chromatic-regulatory factors, leading to epigenetic dysregulation. Almost all patients with synovial sarcoma (SS) carry a characteristic gene fusion, SS18::SSX, which produces a disease-specific oncoprotein that is incorporated into the switch/sucrose non-fermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin-remodeling complexes and profoundly alters their functionalities. Targeting epigenetic dependency in cancers holds promise for improving current treatment. Leveraging on cancer cell dependency dataset, pharmacological tools, and genomic profiling, we find WDR5, a factor critical for depositing histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation, to be an unexplored vulnerability in SS. Mechanistically, WDR5 and SS18::SSX interact and colocalize at oncogenes where WDR5 promotes H3K4 methylation and the chromatin association of SS18::SSX-containing chromatin-remodeling complexes. WDR5 degradation by proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) not only suppresses the SS18::SSX-related oncogenic programs but additionally causes the ribosomal protein deregulations leading to p53 activation. WDR5-targeted PROTAC suppresses SS growth in vitro and in vivo, providing a promising strategy for the SS treatment.",

    "title": "Optimal adaptive cancer therapy based on evolutionary game theory.",
    "abstract": "Cancer development is a dynamic and continuously evolving process, with the emergence of drug-resistant cancer cells being one of the primary reasons for the failure of traditional treatments. Adaptive therapy, as an emerging cancer treatment strategy, is increasingly being applied in oncology. In this study, we incorporate pharmacokinetics into a cancer evolutionary game theory model and propose an optimal control problem constrained by maximum drug concentration and maximum tumor burden. Firstly, we demonstrate the existence of an optimal control for this problem. Secondly, using Pontryagin's minimum principle, we formulated the structure of the optimal control to design an optimal adaptive therapy strategy. Finally, through numerical simulations, we compare the optimal adaptive therapy strategy with other adaptive therapies and traditional treatments, and further develop personalized treatment plans for different patient groups. The results demonstrate that the optimized adaptive treatment strategy effectively preserves a high survival rate of healthy cells during treatment. By maintaining drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cell populations in a state of low-level competition, this approach prevents the proliferation of drug-resistant cells, reduces the tumor burden on patients, and extends overall survival.",

    "title": "Adjuvant chemotherapy compared with observation in patients with resected biliary tract cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.",
    "abstract": "Several randomized controlled trials compared adjuvant systemic chemotherapy with observation in patients with resected biliary tract cancer (BTC) have yielded inconsistent outcomes. In order to assess the efficacy of adjuvant therapy in these patients, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis. We conducted a thorough search in various databases, which included MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ASCO Abstracts, ESMO Abstracts and ClinicalTrials.gov. All relevant randomized controlled trials investigating the adjuvant chemotherapy compared with observation in resected biliary tract cancer were identified. The primary outcome of interest was overall survival (OS), while secondary outcome was relapse-free survival (RFS). Statistical analyses were conducted using Review Manager 5.3. Additionally, publication bias was evaluated using Egger's test in Stata 12.0. A total of 5 randomized controlled trials, involving 1406 patients, were included in this analysis. Compared with observation, adjuvant chemotherapy improved RFS [HR 0.84 (0.73-0.96), p=0.01] (I2=0%, p=0.89) but not OS [HR 0.89 (0.77-1.03), p=0.12] (I2=51%, p=0.09) in the entire population after BTC resection. Subgroup analyses revealed that adjuvant chemotherapy did improve both OS [HR 0.76 (0.62-0.93), p=0.009] (I2=7%, p=0.37) and RFS [HR 0.74 (0.58-0.95), p=0.02] (I2=0%, p=0.39) in patients with lymph node positivity. Furthermore, patients receiving oral fluoropyrimidine monotherapy showed benefit from the adjuvant therapy, with longer OS [HR 0.78 (0.65-0.94), p=0.009] (I2=2%, p=0.31) and RFS [HR 0.81 (0.68-0.95), p=0.01] (I2=0%, p=0.95). To conclude, adjuvant chemotherapy have the potential to offer advantages in patients with resected BTC. Specifically, patients demonstrating positive lymph node status have a higher likelihood of benefiting from adjuvant therapy. Our analysis supports the current standard of care of adjuvant fluoropyrimidine. However, the recommendation of oral fluoropyrimidine monotherapy as the preferred option is not definitive, as it is based on limited studies. Further validation of these outcomes is necessary by conducting extensive randomized controlled trials.",
